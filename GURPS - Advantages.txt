    In order to do anything that
depends on someone else’s reactions,
you must deliberately “slow down”
and function at his speed. This applies
both when making a Feint in combat
and when making an Influence roll
(see p. 359) out of combat. For
instance, if you choose to Feint, that is
all you can do on your turn – you can-
not take extra actions. (On the other
hand, you could make an All-Out
Attack followed by an Attack in order
to beat down his defenses through
sheer blinding speed!)

Alternate Identity 4
       5 or 15 points per identity
    You have multiple, seemingly legal
identities. Each time you purchase
this trait, your fingerprints (or other
biometrics used to verify identity in
your world) are registered under
another name, and you have an extra
set of identity documents (birth cer-
tificate, licenses, passport, etc.) good
enough to pass close inspection. These
identities may also have valid credit
cards and bank accounts, but you
must supply the money – additional
wealth is not included in the package!
    If an intelligence or law-enforce-
ment agency attempts to identify you
with no clue as to your name – for
instance, using biometrics or photo-
analysis – there is an equal chance for
each of your identities to come up.
The search will stop . . . unless they
have reason to believe you are a ringer.
If the search continues, your other
identities will eventually surface, and
you will be unmasked. Once a govern-
ment agency determines who you
really are, your Alternate Identities are
lost for good.
    There are two types of Alternate
Identity:
    Legal: Some spies and undercover
policemen – and even supers, in set-
tings where they are backed by the
government – may have a legal
                                            Identity combined with a Secret            Ambidexterity 3

 senses (for humans: sight, hearing,
 and smell) to a point outside your
 body. This “viewpoint” must be a spe-
 cific location within 10 yards. You can
 modify this range with Increased
 Range (p. 106) or Reduced Range
 (p. 115). You can double your range
 temporarily by spending 2 FP per
 minute.
     To initiate Clairsentience, pick the
 desired viewpoint (which can be
 inside something) and its facing, con-
 centrate for one minute, and then
 make an IQ roll. If the viewpoint is out
 of sight, you must specify distance and
 direction, and the roll is at -5.
     On a success, you can use your
 ranged senses as if you were physical-
 ly present at the viewpoint (this means
 you cannot sense the environment
 around your body!). Your vision
 ignores darkness penalties completely.
 You cannot see through solid objects,
 but if your viewpoint were inside (for
 example) a closed chest, you would
 see what was inside despite the lack of
 light. If you are using or subjected to
 range-dependent abilities (e.g., spells),
 calculate all ranges from your body,
 not your viewpoint. You can maintain
 Clairsentience for as long as you like.
     On failure by 1, your senses go to
 some other viewpoint of the GM’s
 choosing. On any greater failure,
 nothing happens at all. Critical failure
 cripples your ability for 1d hours.
     To return your displaced senses,
 move them elsewhere, or change their
 facing (usually only important for
 vision), you must concentrate for one
 second and make another IQ roll.

     You can “infect” others with a
 supernatural condition – vampirism,
 lycanthropy, etc. – and exert absolute
 control over them. This trait is only
 appropriate for supernatural beings
 that spread their “curse” through
 infection, and only affects members of
 susceptible races (typically your origi-
 nal race and very similar races). The
 GM is the judge of which curses are
 spread this way and who is
 susceptible.
     When you buy Dominance, you
 must specify one natural attack –
 Claws, Innate Attack, Vampiric Bite,
 etc. – that delivers the infection.
 Anyone you damage this way must
 roll 3d vs. the HP of injury he received
 (maximum one roll per day). If he
 rolls under the damage amount, he
 becomes infected, and will change
 into the same kind of creature as you

 unusually good coordination. Supers
 and nonhumans have no such limita-
 tion. A super-powered cop could buy
 two Extra Attacks, enabling him to
 shoot rays from his eyes, fire his pis-
 tol, and swing his nightstick all at
 once. A dragon might take four Extra
 Attacks and attack five times with any
 combination of his four clawed limbs,
 teeth, horns, tail, and fiery breath!
     Extra Attack is exactly that: an
 extra Attack maneuver on your turn in
 combat. It does not eliminate the -4
 penalty for an “off” hand (see
 Ambidexterity, p. 39) or let you take
 multiple Aim maneuvers (see
 Enhanced Tracking, p. 53). You may
 use some of your attacks for Feint
 maneuvers, but you many not take
 multiple actions of other kinds – that
 requires Altered Time Rate (p. 38).
 Extra Attacks and
 All-Out Attack
    When an individual with Extra
 Attacks makes an All-Out Attack, he
 must select one type of bonus for all
 his attacks that turn. He could not, for
 instance, take All-Out Attack
 (Determined) with one attack and All-
 Out Attack (Strong) with another. If he
 chooses All-Out Attack (Double) to
 increase his number of attacks, he gets
 one additional attack.
 Extra Attacks and
 Rapid Strike
    You may use one of your melee
 attacks to make a Rapid Strike (see
 p. 370) on your turn, at the usual
 penalty. Your remaining attacks are in
 addition to this Rapid Strike, and
 receive no penalty. You may not use           You cannot suffer more than 2 ¥        HP/(1.5 ¥ number of heads) points of

 Partial Dice
     You do not have to buy whole-
 numbered dice of damage. Each ±1 to
 damage counts as ±0.3 dice. Round
 the final cost up. For instance, an
 Innate Attack that does 1d+2 damage
 counts as 1.6 dice. If it were crushing
 (5 points/die), it would cost 1.6 ¥ 5 = 8
 points.
     Some attacks do only 1 point of
 damage. This counts as 0.25 dice.
 Once again, round cost up. Such
 attacks can still be deadly – especially
 if they involve the Follow-Up (p. 105)
 or Cyclic (p. 103) enhancement!

   Your wounds heal quickly. This trait comes in two levels:
   Rapid Healing: Whenever you roll to recover lost HP or to see if you
can get over a crippling injury, you get +5 to your effective HT.
Prerequisite: HT 10+. 5 points.
   Very Rapid Healing: As above, but when you roll to recover lost HT, a
successful HT roll means you heal two HP, not one. Prerequisite: HT 12+.

short-term effects of injury, such as stunning and knockout; get

   You can use witty repartee to stun your foes in combat. This does
not require a combat maneuver – talking is a free action (p. 363). Roll

entire group has in common; e.g., they’re all flunkies of the

Opponents with the Unfazeable advantage (p. 95) are
immune to Rapier Wit.
   If you win, your opponent is mentally stunned (see
p. 420). A critical success causes one HP of physical dam-
age as well – your victim injures himself accidentally (drops
something on his foot, chokes on his own tongue, etc.). If
you lose, there is no effect. On a critical failure, you enrage
your opponent, possibly triggering such disadvantages as

 halved range. +10%.
     Multi-Mode: This is only available
 for Radar. You can switch between
 Radar and Imaging Radar. (This is
 much cheaper than buying the two
 advantages separately, because they
 overlap to some extent.) +50%.
     Penetrating: This is only available
 for Para-Radar. You can “see” inside
 any object within range. This func-

 (p. 74). +50%.
     Targeting: By taking an Aim
 maneuver, you can “lock onto” any
 object within range and determine its
 precise range and speed – just as if you
 had a high-tech rangefinder. This gives
 you +3 to hit that target with an aimed
 ranged attack. +20%.
 Special Limitations
    Targeting Only: As Targeting, but
 you can only use your sense to “lock

 another sense; you cannot use it to
 spot things. -40%.

                  Cost of Talents
                     The cost of a Talent depends on the
                  size of the group of skills affected:
                     Small (6 or fewer related skills): 5
                  points/level.
                     Medium (7 to 12 related skills): 10
                  points/level.
                     Large (13 or more related skills): 15
                  points/level.
                     Skills with multiple specialties are
                  considered to be one skill for this pur-
                  pose. Once you buy a Talent, the list of
                  affected skills is fixed. (Exception: The

Voice 3
                            10 points
   You have a naturally clear, reso-
nant, and attractive voice. This gives
you +2 with the following skills:
Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, Mimicry, Per-
formance, Politics, Public Speaking,
Sex Appeal, and Singing. You also
get +2 on any reaction roll made by
someone who can hear your voice.

Walk on Air 3 1
                           20 points
    Air, smoke, and other gases are
like solid ground beneath your
feet, allowing you to walk up and
down “invisible stairs” at your
ground Move. This won’t work in
a vacuum – there has to be some
kind of air present. If you get
knocked down or slip, you fall!
You may attempt one DX roll per
second of falling. If you succeed,
you stop in thin air, unharmed.
Otherwise, you hit the ground for
normal falling damage (see
Falling, p. 431).

Walk on Liquid 3 1
                        15 points
   You can walk on the surface of
any liquid as if it were solid ground.
You move at your usual ground
Move. This doesn’t protect you
from any damage that you would
take from coming into contact with
the liquid, however. You can’t
traverse volcanic lava or boiling acid
without taking damage!

Warp 2 5
                            100 points
   You have the ability to teleport,
traveling from point to point without
moving through the intervening space. To do
so, you must be able to see your destination
with your own eyes, or view it remotely (via
closed-circuit TV, someone else’s eyes using
Mind Reading with the Sensory enhancement,
etc.), or visualize it clearly (which is only possible if
you have visited it previously in person).

    You must “stack” this limitation

Respiratory Agent. It delays the dam-

until some time after exposure. The

    Delays that fall between two values
use the smaller limitation; e.g., 30
minutes is -10%. If you can control the
onset time, take Delay (p. 105) instead.
    A variant limitation is Exposure
Time, which is only available for
attacks with Aura or Persistent. Use it
to represent radioactivity, mildly toxic
gases, etc. It works just like Onset,
except that the victim must be
exposed for the entire period to suffer
the effect (or repeat it, if you continue
exposure). This is worth an extra
-20%; e.g., 1 minute is -30%.
