“Secret” or obscure information might
give a penalty, require a Hidden Lore
skill (p. 199), or simply be unavailable
– GM’s decision. For instance, Area
Knowledge of Washington, D.C. gives
you the location of the Russian
Embassy, but not the KGB’s current
safe house.
    The information covered by Area
Knowledge often overlaps such skills
as Current Affairs, Geography,
Naturalist, and Streetwise. The differ-
ence is that Area Knowledge works for
a single area: you know the habits of
this tiger or gang boss, but have no
special insight into tigers or gangs in
general.
    You can learn Area Knowledge for
any sort of area. The larger the territo-
ry, the less “personal” and more gener-
al your knowledge becomes. Almost
everyone will have Area Knowledge of
some type. The “canonical” area
classes are:
    Neighborhood: For an urban area:
the residents and buildings of a few
city blocks. For a rural area: the inhab-
itants, trails, streams, hiding places,
ambush sites, flora, and fauna of a few
hundred acres.
    Village or Town: All important citi-
zens and businesses, and most unim-
portant ones; all public buildings and
most houses.
    City: All important businesses,
streets, citizens, leaders, etc.
    Barony, County, Duchy, or Small
Nation: General nature of its settle-
ments and towns, political allegiances,
leaders, and most citizens of Status 5+.
    Large Nation: Location of its major
cities and important sites; awareness
of its major customs, ethnic groups,
and languages (but not necessarily
