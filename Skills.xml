		roll (requires at least two hours of
		study, and possibly months to audit a

		This is the ability to perform gym-
		nastic stunts, roll, take falls, etc. This
		can be handy on an adventure, as
		tightrope walking, human pyramids,
		and trapeze swinging all have useful
		applications. Each trick requires a sep-
		arate skill roll, at whatever penalties the
		GM sees fit. If you are performing
		stunts on a moving vehicle or mount,
		roll against the lower of Acrobatics and
		the appropriate Driving or Riding skill.
		You may substitute an Acrobatics
		roll for a DX roll in any attempt to
		jump, roll, avoid falling down, etc. As
		well, you may attempt an Acrobatic
		Dodge in combat – a jump or roll that
		avoids an attack in a flashy way (see
		Acrobatic Dodge, p. 375). Finally, a suc-
		cessful Acrobatics roll will reduce the
		effective distance of any fall by five
		yards (see Falling, p. 431).
		Two special versions of Acrobatics
		are also available:
		Aerobatics: The ability to execute
		tight turns, loops, power dives, etc. in
		flight. You must be able to fly to learn
		this skill – although how you fly (magic,
		wings, jet pack, etc.) is irrelevant.
		Natural fliers might find flight to be as
		effortless as humans find walking, but
		they must still learn Aerobatics in order
		to engage in complex acrobatics. Add
		Aquabatics: The ability to engage in
		underwater acrobatics. Prerequisites:
		Swimming, or the Amphibious advan-
		tage (p. 40) or the Aquatic disadvantage
		Acrobatics, Aerobatics, and
		Aquabatics default to one another at -4.
		Add +1 to these three skills if you have
		Perfect Balance (p. 74).

		Modifiers:  +1 for every point of IQ
		you have over the person you are trying
		to fool (or the smartest one in the
		group), or -1 for every point of differ-
		ence if your victim is smarter than you;
		for Shyness (p. 154); -5 for Truthfulness

		This is the ability to train and work
		with animals. You must specialize in a
		category of animals – the more intelli-
		gent the animals, the narrower the
		category. Examples of interest to
		adventurers: Big Cats (jaguars, lions,
		tigers, etc.), Dogs, Equines (horses
		and donkeys), and Raptors (eagles,
		falcons, and hawks). The default
		between specialties is -2 within the
		same order (e.g., Dogs to Big Cats), -4
		across orders (e.g., Dogs to Equines),
		and -6 for larger differences (e.g., Dogs
		to Raptors).
		To train an animal, make an
		Animal Handling roll once per day of
		training. A failed roll means the ani-
		mal learned nothing; a badly failed
		roll means you are attacked. The time
		it takes to train an animal depends on
		the beast’s intelligence and tractability
		When working with a trained ani-
		mal, roll against skill for each task you
		set the animal. This roll is at -5 if the
		animal is not familiar with you, -5 if
		the circumstances are stressful to the
		animal, and -3 or more if the task is a
		complex one. To put on an entertaining
		circus act, snake-charming show, etc.,
		you must make a separate
		Performance roll!
		This skill can also (sometimes) be
		used to quiet a wild, dangerous, or
		untrained animal. This roll is at -5 if
		the creature is wild or very frightened,
		or -10 if it is a man-eater or man-killer.
		Finally, this skill gives an advantage
		in combat against animals within your
		specialty. If you have Animal Handling
		at level 15, an animal’s attack and
		defense rolls are at -1 against you,
		because you can predict its behavior.
		At skill 20, the animal’s rolls are at -2.

		Anthropology roll might explain, 
		or even predict, unusual rituals and
		folk customs. This skill requires

		although there may be no default for
		completely alien species.
		Optional Rule: Wildcard Skills
		The professor who has studied every science, the swordsman who can
		fight with any blade . . . cinematic fiction is full of heroes who know a lit-
		tle bit about everything in one broad area. The time required to list every
		last skill such a hero might need, and the difficulty of figuring out which
		skills to take (and which to use), might discourage many gamers from
		playing cinematic experts. Such broad expertise doesn’t exist in real life,
		but it is all part of the fun in cinematic games!
		A solution to this problem is “wildcard skills” or “bang skills”: skills
		that cover extremely broad categories of ability. The names of these skills
		end in an exclamation point in order to distinguish them from normal
		skills; e.g., “Science!” is the skill of “all science.” Wildcard skills include and
		replace all  specific skills within their area. For instance, a hero could
		attempt a Science! roll whenever the adventure calls for a roll against
		Chemistry, Physics, or another science skill.
		Wildcard skills that cover mainly intellectual pursuits are IQ-based,
		while those that pertain chiefly to physical actions are DX-based. Such
		skills have no default; to use them, you must spend points on them. Buy
		wildcard skills as Very Hard skills, but at triple the usual point cost. For
		instance, it would normally cost 8 points to buy an IQ/Very Hard skill at
		IQ level, so Science! skill at IQ level would cost 24 points.
		The GM might choose to limit wildcard skills to those with a suitable
		Unusual Background – perhaps “Cinematic Hero.” This Unusual
		Background should never be available to sidekicks and random thugs! To
		give each hero a well-defined dramatic niche, the GM might wish to limit
		PCs to one or two wildcard skills apiece (preferably those that emerge nat-
		urally from their character stories).
		Some examples:
		Detective! (IQ). Replaces Criminology, Detect Lies, Electronics
		Operation (Security and Surveillance), Forensics, Interrogation, Law,
		Observation, Research, Savoir-Faire (Police), Search, Shadowing,
		Streetwise, etc.
		Gun! (DX). Replaces all specialties of Beam Weapons, Gunner, Guns,
		and Liquid Projector, as well as all related Fast-Draw skills. Make an IQ-
		based roll for Armoury pertaining to these weapons.
		Science! (IQ). Replaces Astronomy, Bioengineering, Biology,
		Chemistry, Engineer, Geology, Mathematics, Metallurgy, Meteorology,
		Naturalist, Paleontology, Physics, Psychology, etc.
		Sword! (DX). Replaces Broadsword, Force Sword, Jitte/Sai, Knife,
		Main-Gauche, Rapier, Saber, Shortsword, Smallsword, and Two-Handed
		Sword, as well as related Fast-Draw skills. Use in place of such skills as
		Acrobatics and Jumping for physical stunts while fighting.
		Wildcard skills are useful for omniproficient characters. Someone
		who can pick up and play any instrument, or sight-read any choral work,
		would have the Music! skill. If he’s gifted with several instruments and
		can pick up others easily (but does have to learn them first), that’s the
		Musical Ability Talent.

		default for Area Knowledge of the spe-

		This skill represents familiarity
		with the people, places, and politics of
		a given region. You usually have Area
		Knowledge only for the area you con-
		sider your “home base,” whether that’s
		a single farm or a solar system. If
		information about other areas is avail-
		able, the GM may allow you to learn
		additional Area Knowledge skills.
		The GM should not require Area

		require a roll to locate a smith to shoe
		Skills such as Area Knowledge, Current Affairs
		History (p. 200) require specialization to specific places
		and times. In reality, this kind of knowledge is never
		The following penalties apply when you wish to use
		such a skill outside your specialty.
		Distance
		For an area far from your “stomping grounds,” use
		the penalties under Long-Distance Modifiers (p. 241).
		However, the speed at which knowledge propagates
		increases as progressively more powerful tools for man-
		aging information appear: printing press, telephone, tel-
		evision, computers, faster-than-light radio, etc. To
		reflect this, at TL5 and above, the GM may choose to
		roll 3d against TL+1 (e.g., 9 or less at TL8) to determine
		whether you are familiar with the distant region from
		TV, the Internet, etc. On a success, you may ignore all
		distance penalties. (The GM might also wish to use this
		rule to determine whether a character’s Reputation is
		known far from home in a high-tech setting.)
		Time
		Time is usually only a concern for History skill – but
		it could also apply to Area Knowledge skill in a time-
		travel game, or if someone has been away from home
		for a long time. Use the Long-Distance Modifiers once
		again, substituting years for  miles. For each point of
		tech-level difference, double the time modifier (a two-TL
		difference would be ¥4, etc.). This is because societies
		change drastically on all levels when technology
		increases.
		Area Class
		skill: Neighborhood; Village or Town; City; Barony,
		County, Duchy, or Small Nation; Large Nation; Planet;
		Interplanetary State; and Galaxy. Area class becomes
		important in campaigns that involve a lot of travel. We
		assume here that the smaller areas are contained with-
		in the larger ones.
		If you have specialized in a larger area and want
		information about a smaller area within it, the penalty
		is -2 for one class of difference, -4 for two, -8 for three,
		and so on, doubling each time.
		If you have specialized in a smaller  area and want
		information about a specific locale within the larger
		area containing it, the most appropriate solution is usu-
		ally to use the distance penalties described above.
		However, questions having to do with the entire large
		area use a flat -2 per difference in levels.
		Example:  Someone with Area Knowledge (Earth)
		would be at -8 – due to three classes of difference – to
		know the mayor of Los Angeles. However, someone
		with Area Knowledge (Los Angeles) would be at -4 to
		know the location of Mount Rushmore. The same per-
		son would be at -10 to know the location of the Library
		of Congress in Washington, D.C.; the Library of
		Congress has more to do with Washington than with the
		United States as a whole, and it’s more appropriate to
		resolve the question by considering distance.
		Note that in a setting with multiple planes of exis-
		tence, Area Knowledge skills for one reality can be dan-
		gerously unreliable in another. The GM decides the
		penalty that he will apply when you try to apply your
		knowledge of your San Francisco to his version.
		Geographical and Temporal Scope

		skill (p. 199), or simply be unavailable
		Knowledge of Washington, D.C. gives
		you the location of the Russian
		Embassy, but not the KGB’s current
		safe house.
		The information covered by Area
		Knowledge often overlaps such skills
		as Current Affairs, Geography,
		Naturalist, and Streetwise. The differ-
		ence is that Area Knowledge works for
		a single area: you know the habits of
		this tiger or gang boss, but have no
		special insight into tigers or gangs in
		general.
		You can learn Area Knowledge for
		any sort of area. The larger the territo-
		ry, the less “personal” and more gener-
		al your knowledge becomes. Almost
		everyone will have Area Knowledge of
		some type. The “canonical” area 
		classes are:
		Neighborhood:  For an urban area:
		the residents and buildings of a few
		city blocks. For a rural area: the inhab-
		itants, trails, streams, hiding places,
		ambush sites, flora, and fauna of a few
		hundred acres.
		Village or Town: All important citi-
		zens and businesses, and most unim-
		portant ones; all public buildings and
		most houses.
		City: All important businesses,
		streets, citizens, leaders, etc.
		Barony, County, Duchy, or Small
		Nation: General nature of its settle-
		ments and towns, political allegiances,
		leaders, and most citizens of Status 5+.
		Large Nation: Location of its major
		cities and important sites; awareness
		of its major customs, ethnic groups,
		and languages (but not necessarily
		expertise); names of folk of Status 6+;
		and a general understanding of the
		economic and political situation.
		Planet: As for a large nation, but
		more general; knowledge of people of
		Status 7+ only.
		Interplanetary State: Location of
		major planets; familiarity with all
		known races (but not necessarily
		expertise); knowledge of people of
		Status 7+; general understanding of
		the economic and political situation.
		Galaxy:  Location of the capitals 
		of interplanetary states and the 
		homeworlds of major races; general
		awareness of all major races; knowl-
		edge of individuals of Status 8; gener-
		al understanding of relations between
		interplanetary states.
		Area Knowledge for anything larg-
		er than a galaxy would be meaning-
		lessly vague.
		Your IQ-4 default applies to any of
		these classes, as long as you have lived
		in the area. Defaults are limited by
		level! A TL0 hunter would have a
		default for every level up to “Village or
		Town,” while a TL8 student would
		have defaults up to “Planet” level. You
		must live in an interplanetary or inter-
		stellar state to have defaults for levels
		above “Planet.”
		In some game worlds, Area
		Knowledge specialties may exist for
		parallel realities and other dimensions
		Knowledge (Dream Realms), etc. The
		knowledge such skills provide is left to
		the GM’s judgment.

		This is the ability to build, modify,

		or armor. (It does not include skill at
		design; for that, see Engineer, p. 190.)
		A successful roll lets you find a prob-
		lem, if it isn’t obvious; a second roll
		lets you repair it. Time required is up
		to the GM.
		You  must  specialize in one of the
		following fields:
		Battlesuits:  All kinds of powered
		armor, along with any built-in
		weaponry.
		Body Armor: Any kind of unpow-
		ered personal armor (but not shields).
		Also defaults to Smith (Bronze)-3 at
		TL1, to Smith (Iron)-3 at TL2-4, and to
		Machinist-3 at TL5+.
		Force Shields: Any kind of force
		screen or deflector – be it personal or
		vehicular. This is the same skill as
		Electronics Repair (Force Shields).
		Heavy Weapons: All weapons used
		with the Artillery and Gunner skills.
		Melee Weapons: Any weapon used
		with a Melee Weapon or Thrown
		Weapon skill, as well as all kinds of
		shields. Also defaults to Smith
		TL2-4, and to Machinist-3 at TL5+.
		Missile Weapons: Man-portable,
		pre-gunpowder projectile weapons of
		all kinds – bows, crossbows, slings, etc.
		Small Arms: All weapons used with
		the Beam Weapons and Guns skills.
		Also defaults to Machinist-5 at TL5+.
		Vehicular Armor: All kinds of
		armored vehicle hulls.
		Most specialties default to one
		another at -4 – but above TL4, there is
		no default between Armoury special-
		ties dealing with armor and Armoury
		specialties dealing with weapons. The
		technologies covered by each specialty
		vary with TL. For instance, Armoury
		small arms at TL4, repeating small
		arms that fire cartridges at TL6,
		portable beam weapons at TL10.
		The GM should strictly enforce
		penalties for unfamiliarity.
		Armoury/TL10 (Small Arms) might
		cover both beam weapons and
		portable railguns, but going from one
		to the other gives you -2 to skill until
		you familiarize yourself with all the
		differences.

		within your specialty (e.g., plate
		armor when you’re used to mail);
		equipment modifiers (p. 345).

		This is the ability to use a heavy
		weapon, such as a trebuchet or a how-
		itzer, for indirect  fire – that is, to put
		fire onto a target area via a high bal-
		listic arc or similar path. For direct
		fire, use Gunner skill (p. 198). Roll
		against Artillery skill to bombard the
		target.
		Loaders can make ST-based
		Artillery rolls to improve the rate of
		fire of certain crew-served heavy
		weapons. See the appropriate weapon
		description for details.
		You  must  specialize by weapon
		type. The available specialties vary by
		TL, but include one or more of:
		Beams: Any kind of heavy energy
		weapon that is fired from orbit,
		bounced off a mirror, or otherwise
		used against targets you cannot see.
		Bombs: All kinds of unpowered,
		free-falling munitions.
		Cannon: Any kind of heavy projec-
		tile weapon – bombard, howitzer,
		naval gun, etc.
		Catapult:  Any kind of indirect-fire
		mechanical siege engine, such as a tre-
		buchet.
		Guided Missile: Any kind of seeking
		or remotely piloted missile.
		Torpedoes: Any kind of powered
		underwater projectile.
		There is no default between spe-
		cialties, some of which (e.g.,
		Torpedoes) cover weapons that bear
		little or no resemblance to true
		artillery. Artillery is a single skill only
		because all the weapons it covers use
		the same rules.
		The weapons covered by each spe-
		cialty will vary by TL. For instance,
		Artillery (Cannon) would cover primi-
		tive bombards at TL3, brass cannon at
		TL4, breech-loading howitzers at TL6,
		and orbital railguns at TL9+.
		Familiarity is crucial here! Artillery
		mortars and 406mm naval guns, but
		going from one to the other will give -2
		for weapon type (81mm vs. 406mm),
		fire-direction center), and -2 for
		mount (bipod vs. naval turret), for a
		total of -6 to skill until you familiarize
		yourself with all the differences.
		Note that Forward Observer skill
		nate targets for Artillery skill.
		Modifiers:  All relevant combat
		modifiers; -2 for an unfamiliar fire-
		control system (e.g., map coordinates
		when you’re used to satellite imagery)
		or mount (e.g., a naval turret when
		you’re used to emplaced guns), or for
		an unfamiliar weapon of a known type
		203mm); -4 or more for a weapon in

		person or an object, or a work beauti-
		ful enough to sell (the GM should not
		allow a default roll for this use!). Time

		trance, during which only those who
		can win a Quick Contest of Diagnosis
		vs. your Body Control skill even real-
		ize that you are alive. This requires (30
		imum one second.
		You can also use this skill to flush

		ate) to identify the poison. You cannot
		attempt this roll until you know you
		have been poisoned. In most cases,

		Control roll – adjusted by any modifi-
		er to the HT roll to resist the poison –
		flushes the poison in 1d hours, after
		which it has no further effect.
		Finally, you may use the higher  of

		bers of your species. When dealing with a member of another species,
		apply the following modifiers:
		Species with similar physiology: -2 (human vs. Elf) to -4 (human vs.
		troll).
		Species with very different physiology, but still from your world: -5. This
		includes all normal animals.

		Prerequisite: Psychology.
		This is the “black art” of technolog-
		ical personality alteration and mind
		control. Only intelligence, military,
		and security services teach it – and
		only to individuals with suitable Rank
		or Security Clearance. Even then, it is
		rare outside police states (except per-
		haps during wartime).
		Brainwashing encompasses many
		techniques – some proven, others little
		better than witchcraft. Depending on
		the setting, these might include drugs,
		electroshock, hypnotism, sensory 
		deprivation, sleep deprivation, social
		pressure, subliminal messages, or sur-
		gery . . . and most likely a combination
		of several of these.
		Regardless of the techniques
		employed, brainwashing is handled as
		a Regular Contest (not  a Quick
		Contest) between Brainwashing skill
		and the victim’s Will. Roll once per
		day. Obviously, the brainwasher has a
		tremendous advantage: even if the vic-
		tim wins this time, it is only a matter
		of time before he slips.
		Results depend on how effective
		the GM deems brainwashing to be,
		but might include insanity, personality
		alteration, or suggestions that can be
		triggered by future events. In game
		terms, the victim can acquire almost
		any mental quirk or disadvantage.
		In settings where neural interfaces
		exist, it might be possible to “hack” the
		victim’s brain using a computer. This
		takes only a fraction of a second per
		attempt! Brain Hacking should be
		treated as its own skill, with Computer
		Hacking instead of Psychology as a
		prerequisite.
		This skill normally has no default.
		However, GMs who wish to explore the
		gory details can specify the techniques
		used in their campaign and have
		Brainwashing default to one or more
		of Electronics Operation (Medical)-6,
		Hypnotism-6, Interrogation-6,

		Brawling can also replace DX when
		you attack with teeth, claws, horns, or
		other “natural weapons.”
		Brawling improves damage: if you
		know Brawling at DX+2 level or bet-
		ter, add +1 per die to basic thrust dam-
		age when you calculate damage with
		Brawling attacks – punches, kicks,
		claws, bites, etc. Work out damage
		ahead of time and record it on your
		character sheet.
		Brawling includes the ability to use
		the blackjack or sap. An attack with
		such a fist load is considered a punch
		at +1 to damage.
		When you defend with bare hands,
		Brawling allows you to parry two dif-
		ferent attacks per turn, one with each
		hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3,
		rounded down. Brawling parries are
		at -3 vs. weapons other than thrusting
		attacks. For more on barehanded par-

		This skill allows you to find the
		weakest spot in any object when mak-
		ing a barehanded attack. Each attack
		requires a separate Breaking Blow
		roll. Roll against skill after  you hit.
		Breaking Blow costs 1 FP per attempt,
		whether or not you hit.
		On a success, your attack gains an
		armor divisor of (5) against any
		braced, inanimate, homogenous tar-
		get (see Injury to Unliving,
		Homogenous, and Diffuse Targets,
		p. 380), and you may treat the target
		as if it were Fragile (Brittle) (p. 136)
		for this one attack. 
		In a cinematic game, you are not
		limited to inanimate targets. Your
		armor divisor affects any artificial
		armor or force field (not natural DR),
		and you may treat homogenous oppo-
		nents as if they were Fragile (Brittle)!
		On a failure, your attack gains no
		special benefits. On a critical failure,
		you do the damage to your own hand
		or foot.
		Modifiers: -10 if used instantly,
		dropping to -5 after 1 turn of concen-
		tration, -4 after 2 turns, -3 after 4
		turns, -2 after 8 turns, -1 after 16
		turns, and no penalty after 32 turns. -1

		Prerequisite: Computer

		This is the skill of gaining illegal
		access to a computer system – usually
		using another computer over a com-
		munications network. A successful
		Computer Hacking roll allows you to
		gain surreptitious access to a system,
		or to find (or change) information on
		a system you have already broken
		into. On a critical failure, you fail to
		gain access and leave some sort of
		incriminating evidence of your
		attempt.
		This skill is cinematic, and simu-
		lates the way computer intrusion
		works in many movies and novels. It
		does not exist in realistic settings!
		Realistic “hackers” should learn a
		combination of Computer Operation
		intrusion software), Computer
		Programming (to write intrusion soft-
		ware), Cryptography, Electronics
		Operation (Communications or
		Surveillance), Electronics Repair
		legitimate users to reveal passwords),
		Research (to find documented securi-
		ty holes), and Scrounging (to
		words on discarded sticky notes, etc.).
		Modifiers:  Equipment modifiers
		away from the field for a long time
		and have not had a chance to become
		familiar with the changes. Security
		measures give a penalty, from -1 for
		the cheapest commercial security soft-
		ware to -15 for the latest technology.
		Some measures resist your intrusion
		attempt; treat this as a Quick Contest
		of Hacking vs. the effective skill of the
		defenses.

		rogue states, except in wartime). Time
		required varies from days to weeks
		against your Counterfeiting skill for
		each “batch” of money.

		fakes in that batch are as good as the
		real thing.
		An ordinary success means that
		your work is good but not perfect.
		Whenever you try to pass the counter-
		feit money, the GM makes a second

		ent spots your handiwork. To success-

		who has reason to be suspicious, you
		must win a Quick Contest of

		Perception, Forensics, and Merchant.

		meteorology, or to recall laws and reg-
		ulations that pertain to your vehicle.
		This skill also lets you steer the ves-
		sel. It is easier than Piloting,
		Submarine, and similar skills because
		it  only  includes knowledge of how to
		steer. Specialists handle such activities
		as plotting courses and operating sen-
		sors. These experts report to the cap-
		tain, who in turn tells you how to
		maneuver. Make a DX-based skill roll
		whenever you take the helm – but note
		that your effective skill cannot exceed
		your captain’s Shiphandling skill

		entire crew can be used as a measure
		of overall crew quality. The GM rolls
		against average skill whenever the
		vehicle arrives or departs, in unfavor-
		able conditions, or in battle. Failure
		and critical failure results depend on
		the circumstances.
		There is a separate skill for each
		class of vessel:
		Airshipman/TL:  The skill of han-
		dling ballast, gas valves, mooring
		lines, etc. on a blimp, zeppelin, or
		other large airship.
		Seamanship/TL: The skill of operat-
		ing anchors, hatches, mooring lines,
		pumps, sails, windlasses, etc. aboard a
		large surface ship (but not  a subma-
		rine).
		Spacer/TL:  The skill of working
		with airlocks, docking clamps, hull
		patches, pressure doors, etc. on a large
		spacecraft or space base.
		Submariner/TL:  The skill of han-
		dling pressure doors, pumps, valves,
		etc. aboard a submarine or in an
		undersea base.

		many settings, some level of Security
		Clearance is a prerequisite to learning
		this skill at all.

		unknown code as a Quick Contest of
		Cryptography skill between the code-
		breaker and code-maker. The code-
		breaker must win  to break the code.
		Repeated attempts are possible, but
		each attempt takes a day. The code-
		maker rolls only once, when he first
		creates the code.
		Those with Cryptography skill may
		take an optional  specialty (p. 169) in
		making or breaking codes. (The code-
		breaking specialty is often called
		Cryptography normally has no  IQ
		default, with two exceptions. Anyone

		Likewise, anyone can make an IQ-5
		roll to attempt to break such a trivial
		code (but not a code devised by some-
		one with Cryptography skill), using
		the Quick Contest system described

		sample of the code with translation,
		and -5 if the message to be decoded is
		shorter than 25 words. The code-
		maker receives a bonus for the time
		taken to create the code: consult the

		tion roll. Failure with Fast-Talk or Sex
		Appeal alienates the subject, but

		course of action when you are negoti-
		ating, or to choose the best approach
		to take. 
		If you know Diplomacy at level 20
		or better, you get a +2 bonus on all

		This is the art of altering your
		appearance using clothing, makeup,
		and prosthetics. You do not need this
		skill to don a quick disguise – e.g., to
		put on a lab coat when you enter a lab-
		oratory – but such disguises only fool
		the inattentive! A good  disguise
		requires a Disguise roll and 30 
		minutes to an hour of preparation.
		Roll a Quick Contest of Disguise
		skill vs. the Perception of each person
		your disguise must fool. Individuals
		with Criminology or Observation skill
		may substitute those skills for
		Perception when rolling to penetrate a
		disguise. The GM may allow other
		skills to be of use – for instance,
		Physician skill might help spot a rub-
		ber nose.
		When combining Acting (p. 174)
		with Disguise (that is, when you must
		change your face and your personali-
		ty), you need only make one roll for
		each person or group – but it must be
		the harder of the two rolls.
		If there is more than one sapient
		species in your world, you must  spe-
		cialize by race – Disguise (Human) is
		nothing like Disguise (Bug-Eyed
		Monster). Disguise specialized in your
		own species is the most common
		form; just list this as “Disguise” on
		your character sheet. Disguise skills
		for physically similar species default
		to one another at -2 to -4.
		Modifiers:  Equipment modifiers
		You are at -1 to -5 to disguise yourself
		as someone very different from you
		ance also gives a penalty – see Build
		and specific disadvantages (e.g.,
		Hunchback, p. 139) for details.
		Differences in Size Modifier usually
		make Disguise impossible.
		You can also learn Disguise
		tures. This involves wearing animal
		skins, smearing your body with musk
		or dung, etc. There is no default
		between this and other Disguise spe-
		cialties. Use the following modifiers
		instead of those given above.
		Modifiers:  +2 if approaching from
		downwind; -1 for each animal over one
		of the same type being approached (-1
		for every 10 in the case of herd ani-
		mals); -1 to -3 if the skins are old or in
		poor condition. Make a Naturalist roll
		to recall the habits of the animal being
		imitated; success gives +1 to +3, while
		failure gives -1 to -3.

		This is the skill of controlling and

		ful skill roll lets you experience vivid
		dreams about a subject of your choos-
		ing. Use the Fortune-Telling (Dream
		Interpretation) skill to interpret your
		dreams. In some game worlds, this
		might be a useful divinatory technique
		A Dreaming roll can also help you
		recall a previously forgotten piece of
		information, or something you wit-
		nessed but did not consciously note.
		This technique is much less reliable
		than Eidetic Memory (p. 51), though.
		The GM will describe your dreams to
		you, working clues into the narrative.
		It is up to you, the player, to spot these
		hints!
		Finally, you can use this skill to
		combat malign supernatural influ-
		ences on your dreams. Resolve this as
		a Quick Contest between your
		Dreaming skill and your harasser’s
		skill at dream control. If you win, you
		shut out the external influence.

		Note that the ability to “drive” a
		team of animals is not Driving, but
		Teamster (p. 225).
		Modifiers: -2 or more for bad driv-

		Make a skill roll in an emergency situ-
		ation or for “abnormal” use of equip-
		ment – not for ordinary, everyday use.
		always attempt their default roll!)
		You must specialize. Available spe-
		cialties vary by game world, but might
		include:
		Communications (Comm): All
		forms of electronic communications
		technology: radios, satellite uplinks,
		laser communicators, etc. Includes
		knowledge of any standard, current
		communications codes appropriate to
		your background. These do not
		require a skill roll – although attempts
		to understand or use an unfamiliar
		code do  require a roll. At TL5-7, this
		includes telegraphy: you can send or
		receive 2 words per minute (wpm) per
		point of skill at TL5, 3 wpm per point
		of skill at TL6-7.
		Electronic Warfare (EW): All sig-
		nals-intelligence and jamming equip-
		ment, including electronic counter-
		measures (ECM) and electronic
		counter-countermeasures (ECCM). In
		most game worlds, only intelligence
		agencies and the military teach this
		specialty – and only to individuals
		with suitable Military Rank (p. 30) or
		Security Clearance (p. 82).
		Force Shields: Portable, vehicular,
		base, and starship force shields and
		deflectors.
		Matter Transmitters (MT): All mat-
		ter transmitters and teleporters.
		Critical failures can be disastrous,
		especially when transmitting living
		beings!
		Media: All forms of audio, film, and
		video editing equipment. If three-
		dimensional video (“holographics”) or
		sensory recordings (“sensies”) exist in
		the setting, this specialty includes the
		ability to operate the relevant equip-
		ment. Treat different media as mutu-
		ally unfamiliar technologies.
		Medical: All manner of electronic
		diagnostic and life-support equip-
		ment.
		Parachronic:  Technological means
		of travel between dimensions or time-
		lines.
		Psychotronics: Psionic technology,
		such as telepathic shields and ampli-
		fiers.
		Scientific:  Laboratory electronics
		and survey gear. You are automatically
		familiar with the equipment used with
		any scientific skill on which you have
		spent at least one point.
		Security: Both operating and cir-
		cumventing all forms of alarms, secu-
		rity sensors, and area-surveillance
		technology.
		Sensors: Most forms of long-range
		detection gear, from air-defense radar
		to starship sensor suites. Certain high-
		ly specialized sensors (such as sonar,
		below) have their own specialties.
		Sonar:  All types of acoustic detec-
		tion and ranging gear (normally used
		underwater).
		Surveillance: All forms of conceal-
		able or remote surveillance gear:
		microphones, wiretaps, etc.
		Temporal:  All manner of time
		machines. Critical failures can be dis-
		astrous for the time travelers! Make
		separate rolls to “lock onto” and trans-
		fer the travelers.
		These specialties default to one
		another at -4; however, the GM is free
		to rule that in his campaign, there is no
		default between exotic specialties
		mundane ones (Media, Security, etc.).
		The technologies covered by a particu-
		lar specialty vary with TL. For instance,
		Electronics Operation (Comm) covers
		telegraphs at TL5, telephones and
		radios at TL6, and digital communica-
		tions systems at TL8 . . . and might
		cover faster-than-light or telepathic
		communicators at higher TLs.
		Familiarity (p. 169) is crucial here!
		Electronics Operation/TL8 (Sensors)
		covers both thermographs on fighter
		jets and ground-penetrating radars on
		satellites, but going from one to the
		other gives you -2 for type (thermo-
		graph to radar) and -2 for implemen-
		tation (jet to satellite), for a net -4 to
		skill until you familiarize yourself
		with all the differences.
		Modifiers:  Equipment modifiers
		ogy of a known type (e.g., radar when
		you are used to thermograph) or an
		unfamiliar implementation of a famil-
		iar technology (e.g., air-defense radar
		when you are used to weather radar);
		the field for a long time (this varies by
		field) and have not had a chance to
		become familiar with the changes.

		Prerequisites: Mathematics
		noted.
		This is the ability to design and
		build technological devices and sys-
		tems. A successful roll lets you design
		a new system, diagnose a glitch, iden-
		tify the purpose of a strange device, or
		improvise a gadget to solve a problem.
		Time required for each attempt is up
		to the GM.
		Note that engineers are designers
		and inventors; they are not necessarily
		skilled at the routine operation or
		maintenance of the things they
		design! For instance, Engineer (Small
		Arms) lets you design a new assault
		rifle, but you need Armoury skill to
		maintain it and Guns skill to shoot it.
		You must specialize. Possible fields
		include:
		Artillery: Designing whatever pass-
		es for artillery at your TL, from tre-
		buchets to smart missiles. Default:
		Armoury (Heavy Weapons)-6.
		Civil: Planning highways, aque-
		ducts, buildings, etc. Default:
		Architecture-6.
		Clockwork: Designing wind-up
		gadgetry – watches, mechanical men,
		and the like. Default: Mechanic
		Combat: Building or removing for-
		tifications, trenches, etc. Default:
		Explosives (Demolition)-6.
		Electrical: Designing electrical sys-
		tems, such as power cells and trans-
		mission lines. Default: Electrician-6.
		Electronics: Designing and building
		electronic apparatus, from computers
		to starship sensor arrays. (The specific
		technologies involved – vacuum tubes,
		transistors, photonics, etc. – will
		depend on the tech level.) Default:
		Electronics Repair (any)-6.
		Materials: Concocting new struc-
		tural materials. Prerequisites:
		Chemistry or Metallurgy. Defaults:
		Chemistry-6 or Metallurgy-6.
		Microtechnology: Designing micro-
		machines.  Default: Mechanic
		Mining: Designing underground
		structures.  Defaults: Explosives
		Nanotechnology: Designing
		nanomachines.  Default: Mechanic
		Parachronic:  Designing apparatus
		for crossing dimensions or timelines.
		Prerequisite: Physics.  Default:
		Electronics Operation (Parachronic)-
		6, but there is no default if your socie-
		ty has not discovered dimensional
		travel.
		Psychotronics:  Designing psionic
		technology, such as telepathic shields
		and amplifiers. Default: Electronics
		Operation (Psychotronics)-6, but
		there is no default for individuals from
		backgrounds where psionics do not
		exist.
		Robotics:  Designing robotics and
		cybernetics.  Default: Mechanic
		Small Arms: Designing personal
		firearms, such as guns and portable
		rocket launchers. Default:
		Armoury
		Temporal:  Designing time
		machines. Prerequisite: Physics.
		Default: Electronics Operation
		Skills for Design, Repair, and Use
		When choosing technological skills for your character, it can be
		helpful to bear in mind that such skills govern three distinct classes of
		activity:
		Design. An inventor, gadgeteer, or mad scientist requires skills that
		let him design and build new inventions, redesign existing ones, and
		deduce the function of (and reverse-engineer!) unknown technologies.
		The key skill here is Engineer – specialized in the inventor’s fields of
		interest – but Bioengineering (for biotechnology) and Computer
		Programming (for software) are equally appropriate.
		Repair. A craftsman or technician needs skills that enable him to
		troubleshoot and repair known devices, perform major overhauls and
		upgrades, install new equipment, and customize existing gear. The
		most important skills of this type are Armoury, Electrician, Electronics
		Repair, Machinist, and Mechanic.
		Use. A detective, soldier, spy, or similar professional needs skills that
		let him operate specialized equipment, conduct routine maintenance
		on his gear, and identify common makes and models (and their
		strengths and weaknesses). Such skills include Computer Operation,
		Electronics Operation, Environment Suit, Explosives, vehicle skills
		Guns, etc.).
		These skills form “design-repair-use triads”; e.g., Engineer
		devices, Engineer (Vehicle)-Mechanic-Driving for vehicles, and
		Engineer (Small Arms)-Armoury-Guns for firearms. Cinematic adven-
		turers with great depth of knowledge often have all three skills in a triad!
		for individuals from backgrounds
		without time travel!
		Vehicle Type: Designing a single,
		broad class of vehicle. Examples
		include Engineer (Automobiles),
		Engineer (Ships), and Engineer
		vehicle type)-6.
		Engineer specialties normally
		default to one another at -4; however,
		the GM is free to rule that in his cam-
		paign, there is no default between
		exotic specialties (Nanotechnology,
		Parachronic, Psychotronics, etc.) and
		more mundane ones (Civil, Combat,
		Mining, etc.).
		Modifiers:  Equipment modifiers
		you can give the GM a good descrip-
		tion of what you want it to do.

		Prerequisites: Charisma 1 and
		Public Speaking at 12+.
		Bards in fantasy can often influ-
		ence others through storytelling. The
		GM may choose to represent this abil-
		ity using the four Enthrallment skills
		described below. Depending on the
		setting, these skills might be magical,
		psionic, or a cinematic form of hypno-
		tism. Each has a time requirement, FP
		cost, and duration, and requires two
		skill rolls to use.
		At the outset of the tale, roll vs.
		Public Speaking skill; if you can’t grab
		your audience’s attention early on, you
		won’t have much of a chance of con-
		trolling them by the end. On a success,
		proceed to the Enthrallment skill roll;
		critical success gives +1 on that roll. On
		a failure, you may still attempt the
		Enthrallment roll, but at a penalty
		equal to your margin of failure. Critical
		failure means your Enthrallment
		attempt fails automatically.
		After the time required to enthrall
		has passed, roll a Quick Contest of
		your Enthrallment skill vs. the Will of
		each audience member. If you win,
		you affect your audience – see the
		individual skill description for effects.
		If you lose or tie, there is no effect.
		However, if you critically  fail, your
		audience instantly turns hostile!
		You may never learn these skills at
		a skill level higher than your Public
		Speaking skill.
		Audience Size: An “audience” can
		be one listener or a hundred – as many
		as can hear the tale. However, the
		number of audience members that
		you can enthrall at one sitting is limit-
		ed to your Charisma level squared, to a
		maximum of 25 people at Charisma 5.
		Modifiers:  All four Enthrallment
		skills are at -3 for Low Empathy
		good tale, the GM should reward him
		with +1 to +3 to the Public Speaking
		and Enthrallment rolls!

		Prerequisite: Suggest at 12+.
		This skill allows you to tell a story
		so skillfully that those listening lose
		their will and do whatever you want
		them to do. In effect, they believe
		themselves to be in  the tale, and are
		vulnerable to being manipulated by
		you, the teller of the tale.
		If you win the Quick Contest, the
		audience becomes intensely loyal to
		you. They follow any direct order you
		give. In the absence of a direct order,
		they act in your best interest, as they
		understand it. If you tell someone to
		do something very hazardous, or that
		goes against his usual code of behav-
		ior (GM’s decision), he gets a Will-5
		roll to break the captivation.
		Otherwise, he is your loyal supporter
		for all intents and purposes.
		Time: 30 minutes of uninterrupted
		storytelling.
		Fatigue Cost: 8 FP, whether suc-
		cessful or not.
		Duration: Captivation lasts until the
		subject becomes unconscious or falls
		asleep, you become unconscious or fall
		asleep, you attack the subject, or the
		subject loses half his HP to injury.

		suggestion should have no complex
		grammatical clauses – just a subject,
		verb, object, and at most two modi-
		fiers. “Kill the king!” is acceptable;

		suit is in good repair, make an IQ-
		based skill roll instead.
		When rolling against DX or any
		DX-based skill while suited up, use the
		lower  of your Environment Suit skill
		and your actual skill level. For
		instance, if you have DX 14, Stealth-
		15, and Vacc Suit-13, you will function
		at DX 13 and Stealth-13 while wearing
		a spacesuit. Particularly ungainly suits
		might give -1 or more to DX on top of
		this, regardless of skill level. On the
		other hand, some sleek, ultra-tech
		suits might not limit skills at all!
		However, Environment Suit is
		strictly the skill of donning and operat-
		ing the suit. Familiarity with and
		knowledge of dangerous environments
		is covered by other skills: Free Fall,
		Hazardous Materials, Survival, etc.
		Each suit type requires its own
		skill. Examples include:
		Battlesuit/TL: All kinds of powered
		battle armor and exoskeletons. Battle
		armor and exoskeletons are similar
		but not identical. If you only have
		experience with one, you are at -2 to
		operate the other until you gain 
		familiarity (see Familiarity, p. 169).
		Diving Suit/TL: All types of hard
		diving suits (as opposed to the wet-
		suits and drysuits used with Scuba
		skill). This includes “open dress” gear
		at TL5 and “hard hat” gear at TL6,
		both of which use a sealed helmet and
		supplied air, but not always a full,
		sealed suit. At TL7+, this skill covers
		true underwater “hardsuits.” The GM
		may require Swimming rolls to
		maneuver  while wearing such a suit.
		Default: Scuba-2.
		NBC Suit/TL: All forms of haz-
		ardous materials (“HazMat”) gear –
		including sealed, unpowered body
		armor that can be buttoned down
		against nuclear-biological-chemical
		run the risk of misusing the equipment
		and being exposed to contamination.
		To  improvise  NBC gear, make an IQ-
		based skill roll at -5 to -15 to skill.
		Vacc Suit/TL: Any kind of spacesuit.
		In addition to true vacuum suits, this
		includes suits intended for use in high-
		pressure, corrosive, and poisonous
		atmospheres.
		Battlesuit, NBC Suit, and Vacc Suit
		default among themselves at -2.
		Diving Suit defaults to or from any
		other Environment Suit skill at -4.
		Note that unpowered, unsealed
		body armor never requires an
		Environment Suit skill.

		This is the ability to slip out of

		takes one minute; each subsequent
		attempt takes 10 minutes.
		The GM may apply a penalty for
		particularly secure bonds. For

		would give -5 to Escape. You suffer
		only half  these penalties if you dislo-
		cate the restrained limb (usually an
		arm). This requires (20 - skill) minutes
		of concentration, minimum one
		minute and a Will roll. However, if you
		fail your Escape roll by 3 or more
		when dislocating a limb, the limb suf-

		This is the skill of treating illness

		in esoteric theory rather than analyti-
		cal science. It is usually associated
		with a magical or spiritual tradition.
		The particulars vary by tradition, but
		might include acupuncture, massage,
		alchemical or herbal preparations, or
		such exercises as breath control and
		meditation.
		The effectiveness of Esoteric
		Medicine relative to Physician (p. 213)
		is up to the GM. It might be more
		effective (especially if it can channel
		real supernatural power), equivalent
		but different, or less effective. It
		should always be at least as good as
		First Aid (p. 195) – the attentions of a
		trained healer of any kind are prefer-
		able to bleeding to death! In TL5+ set-
		tings, Esoteric Medicine is often per-
		ceived as “quack” medicine, regardless
		of actual effectiveness.
		This skill might represent Ayurvedic
		medicine,  chi  treatment, Hermetic
		medicine, yin/yang healing, or any
		other historical or fictional healing dis-
		cipline. In settings where multiple
		forms of treatment exist, healers must
		specialize in one specific tradition.

		This is the ability to drive a spirit
		from a possessed person or haunted
		location. It is not a magical skill, but a
		religious ritual. Exorcism is not specif-
		ic to any one religion. A Malay witch
		doctor and a Catholic priest can both
		perform exorcisms; their relative effec-
		tiveness depends on the originating
		culture of the spirit.
		The length of the ritual is 15 min-
		utes ¥ the spirit’s HT. Some spirits wait
		patiently through the ritual, anticipat-
		ing the combat to come; others try to
		distract or even attack you before you
		can complete the ritual. Once the ritu-
		al is complete, roll against Exorcism
		skill.
		On a failure, the spirit remains and
		you must wait at least a week before
		you can repeat the ritual. On a critical
		failure, immediately roll 3d+10 on the
		Fright Check Table (p. 360). Even if you
		keep your sanity, you may never
		attempt to exorcise this particular
		spirit again.
		On a critical success, you immedi-
		ately banish the spirit. On a regular
		success, you meet your opponent in a
		Quick Contest: your Exorcism skill vs.
		the  higher  of the spirit’s ST or Will.
		When fighting a spirit in a living host,
		add higher of the ST or Will of the pos-
		session victim to your Exorcism skill
		as he tries to “push the spirit out.”
		If the spirit wins or ties, it retains
		its current status and you must wait at
		least a week before you can repeat the
		ritual. If you win, you drive the spirit
		from its haunt or victim. The spirit of
		a deceased mortal is laid to rest. For
		demons and similar entities, make a
		reaction roll. On a “Poor” or better
		reaction, the spirit flees in humilia-
		tion. On a “Bad” or worse reaction, the
		spirit immediately uses whatever
		resources it has to take vengeance on
		you and those nearby.
		If the exorcism fails at any stage,
		make an IQ roll afterward. A success
		means that you learned something
		about the spirit that will help you in
		your next  attempt to banish that foe,
		giving you +2 on later skill rolls. You
		may only claim this bonus once for a
		particular spirit.
		Modifiers: -4 if you do not have one
		or more of Blessed (p. 40), Power
		Investiture (p. 77), or True Faith
		ual, but you lack holy support.

		An Expert Skill represents cross-
		disciplinary knowledge of a single,
		narrow theme. When answering fac-
		tual questions on that theme, you may
		substitute a roll against your Expert
		Skill for any IQ-based roll against any
		skill that has a default. Expert Skills
		do not exempt you from Cultural
		Familiarity (p. 23) or Language
		vide the ability to do practical tasks.
		Experts sometimes complement
		Expert Skills with related Area
		Knowledge skills (p. 176), but you
		must learn these separately.
		You must specialize by theme, and
		the GM is free to forbid any theme he
		feels is too broad. Some examples:
		Computer Security: Expertise at
		combating computer intrusion
		Computer Operation, Cryptography,
		or Electronics Operation to spot
		system. Use Computer Programming
		to patch or exploit such holes.
		Conspiracy Theory: The study of
		interlocking networks of conspiracies.
		Can substitute for Anthropology,
		Geography, History, Literature, or
		Occultism to answer questions about
		conspiracies, and can also work as
		Intelligence Analysis for this purpose
		inner secrets, which are the province
		of Hidden Lore (p. 199).
		Egyptology:  The study of ancient
		Egypt. Can function as Anthropology,
		Archaeology, History, Linguistics, or
		Occultism for that purpose.
		Epidemiology:  The study of the
		spread of disease. Can serve as
		Biology, Diagnosis, Forensics,
		Geography, or Mathematics when
		deducing how a disease was spread.
		Hydrology: The study of a planet’s
		water. Can be used in place of Biology,
		Chemistry, Geography, Geology, or
		Meteorology to answer questions
		about precipitation, flooding, 
		irrigation, etc.
		Military Science: General expertise
		on military capabilities. Can substi-
		tute for Artillery, Armoury, Strategy, or
		Tactics to answer questions about –
		but not use – weapons or strategies.
		Natural Philosophy: A general skill
		that usually replaces specific science
		skills (which might not even exist yet!)
		for scholars at TL1-4. Can be used in
		place of any science skill (e.g., Biology
		or Physics) to answer questions about
		how the universe is believed to work.
		Political Science: The academic
		study of politics. Can substitute for
		Geography, History, Law, Politics, or
		Sociology when performing political
		analysis.
		Psionics:  The study of the psionic
		mind and brain. Can function as
		Biology, Diagnosis, Physician,
		Physiology, or Psychology when deal-
		ing with psi phenomena in living
		beings.  Cannot substitute for
		Electronics Operation, Electronics
		Repair, and Engineer specialties that
		deal with psychotronics.
		Thanatology: The esoteric study of
		death. Can stand in for Anthropology,
		Archaeology, Occultism, or Theology
		when dealing with death and the dead.
		Xenology:  General knowledge of
		the known  races in your setting. Can
		substitute for Anthropology, History,
		Physiology, or Psychology to identify a
		member of a race different from your
		own, or to answer general questions
		about the race and its culture.

		This is the skill of working with
		explosives and incendiaries.
		You must specialize:
		Demolition: The ability to prepare
		and set explosives in order to blow
		things up. Make a roll whenever you
		use explosives in this way. A failure
		indicates an error. The gravity of the
		error depends on the amount by
		which you failed; a badly failed roll in
		close quarters can blow you up! Time
		required varies – it takes only a cou-
		ple of seconds to set a prepared
		charge, but it might take hours to
		demolish a large bridge or a sky-
		scraper. When setting an explosive
		trap, use this skill rather than Traps.
		Rolls to set a “trap” fuse (e.g., a land
		mine) instead of a timed fuse are at
		Explosive Ordnance Disposal
		pose of bombs and other explosives.
		When disarming a trap, roll a Quick
		Contest of your Explosives (EOD)
		skill vs. the Explosives (Demolition)
		skill of the person who created the
		device. A failure (or even a critical
		failure) does not necessarily mean an
		explosion – the GM can be much
		more creative than that! Sudden hiss-
		ing noises, mysterious parts falling
		off, cramps, itches, and alarm bells
		are all possible in the right circum-
		stances. It is best if the GM rolls the
		dice and describes the physical cir-
		cumstances to the victim. Fright
		Checks are appropriate for the sur-
		vivors of a failed EOD attempt!
		Prerequisite: DX 12+.
		Fireworks: The skill of making
		pyrotechnic devices – fireworks,
		flares, smoke bombs, flash grenades,
		etc. Most of these things can be used
		by anyone. Default: Chemistry-3.
		Nuclear Ordnance Disposal
		a military nuclear weapon is straight-
		forward; disarming a homemade ter-
		rorist bomb might be more difficult.
		Only a critical failure verified by a sec-
		ond critical failure will result in a
		nuclear detonation. Any lesser failure
		will – at worst – detonate the high-
		explosive trigger and contaminate the
		immediate area with radioactive
		material . . . not that this is a great
		deal of consolation to those nearby.
		Underwater Demolition (UD): The
		ability to prepare and set explosives
		underwater. This is otherwise 
		identical to Explosives (Demolition).
		You usually need Scuba skill – or at
		least Swimming skill – to get into a
		position where you can use this skill.
		These specialties default to one
		another at -4 except for Demolition
		and UD, which default to one another
		at -2, and EOD and NOD, which also
		default to one another at -2.
		Modifiers:  Equipment modifiers

		This skill lets you quickly  draw a
		weapon from its holster, sheath, or
		hiding place. A successful roll means
		you ready the weapon instantly. This
		does not count as a combat maneuver;
		you can use the weapon to attack on
		the same turn. On a failure, you ready
		your weapon normally but may do
		nothing else on your turn. A critical
		failure means you drop the weapon!
		You must specialize in one of these
		weapon types: Force Sword, Knife,
		Long Arm (rifle, shotgun, submachine
		gun, etc.), Pistol, Sword (any one-
		handed blade larger than a knife), or
		Two-Handed Sword. The GM may add
		Fast-Draw skills for other weapons (or
		even tools) that one could reasonably
		draw quickly.
		In addition to the above specialties,
		there are two Fast-Draw skills that
		allow you to reload missile weapons
		quickly:
		Fast-Draw (Arrow): Lets you ready
		a single arrow, bolt, or dart instantly.
		This reduces the time required to
		reload a bow, crossbow, or blowgun by
		one second.
		Fast-Draw/TL (Ammo): Reduces
		the time required to reload any kind of
		gun or beam weapon. The exact bene-
		fits depend on your weapon, but a suc-
		cessful roll always shaves at least one
		second off the reload time. This skill
		varies greatly with TL! At TL4, it cov-
		ers powder-and-shot drills; at TL6+, it
		includes speed-loading techniques for
		detachable magazines; and at higher
		tech levels, it involves quickly replac-
		ing energy cells and attaching power
		cables.
		For the Arrow and Ammo special-
		ties, failure means you drop the arrow
		or bolt, or accidentally discard one
		round of ammunition. On a critical
		failure, you drop the entire quiver,
		powder horn, ammo box, magazine,
		etc., scattering loose ammunition
		everywhere!
		Modifiers: Combat Reflexes (p. 43)
		gives +1 to all Fast-Draw specialties;
		Ham-Fisted (p. 138) gives -3 per level.

		working as a salesman, confidence
		man, lawyer, etc. In any situation that
		calls for a reaction roll, you may make
		an Influence roll against Fast-Talk
		instead; see Influence Rolls (p. 359).
		If you have Fast-Talk at level 20 or
		better, you get +2 on all reaction rolls
		where you’re allowed to talk!
		Note that Fast-Talk differs from
		Acting (p. 174). In general, Fast-Talk is
		used to get someone to make a snap
		decision in your favor, while Acting is
		used for long-term dissimulation.
		However, there are situations in which
		the GM could allow a roll on either
		skill.
		Modifiers:  +2 for Voice (p. 97); -3
		for Low Empathy (p. 142); -1 for
		Oblivious (p. 146); -1 to -4 for Shyness
		for Truthfulness (p. 159). The GM may
		ask you for details of the story you are
		using, rather than just let you say, “I’m
		using Fast-Talk.” Your approach and
		the plausibility of the story may fur-
		ther modify the roll, at the GM’s dis-

		This skill allows you to make

		attempt, successful or not.
		On a success, you may immediate-

		jumping rules (see Jumping, p. 352),
		but triple your jumping distance. On a
		failure, you may still attempt the
		jump, but you receive no bonus and
		make all jumping-related rolls at -5.
		On a critical failure, you fall down!
		You may use Flying Leap to jump
		into  someone as part of an attack.
		Such attacks are at an extra -2 to hit,
		but if you do hit, triple your ST for
		damage and knockback purposes. In
		a slam or collision, calculate Move
		from jumping distance as described
		for Super Jump (p. 89), and use this

		Modifiers: -10 if used instantly,
		dropping to -5 after 1 turn of concen-

		This is the ability to kick in doors
		and windows, or demolish them with
		a crowbar, ram, or sledgehammer,
		without necessarily being adept at
		melee combat. Make a skill roll to hit
		an inanimate object with your foot or
		an impact weapon. Add +1 per die to
		basic thrust or swing damage if you
		have this skill at DX+1, +2 per die if
		you know it at DX+2 or better. Add a
		similar bonus (+1 or +2) to ST rolls
		made for forced entry. The damage
		bonus also applies when you use
		Melee Weapon skills to wreck inani-
		mate objects out of combat.
		For  subtle break-ins, use

		This is the ability to create falsified
		documents (identity cards, passports,
		etc.). It is not taught except by intelli-
		gence agencies and the underworld –
		although you can always study it on
		your own.
		The time required to create a for-
		gery ranges from days to weeks (GM
		decides). When you use a forged doc-
		ument, make your Forgery roll each
		time it is inspected – unless you roll a
		critical success on your first attempt.
		Failure means someone spots the for-
		gery.
		Some tasks require DX-based skill
		rolls, in which case modifiers for High
		Manual Dexterity (p. 59) or Ham-
		Fisted (p. 138) apply. The GM may
		allow Forgery to default to a suitable
		Artist specialty at -5 if you are doing
		the work entirely by hand.
		Modifiers:  Equipment modifiers
		uine document; -5 if you did not have
		a sample to copy. The GM may also
		assign modifiers based on the severity
		of the inspection; a routine border
		check, for instance, would give a +5

		or religious beliefs (especially those of
		your subject) can also lend an air of
		legitimacy.
		With the GM’s permission, you can
		sometimes use Fortune-Telling in
		place of Fast-Talk (by making predic-
		tions that guide the subject toward a
		particular course of action), or
		Interrogation or Psychology (by ask-
		ing the subject leading questions
		under the pretense of telling his for-
		tune). This is only possible if the sub-
		ject believes you are a genuine for-
		tune-teller and you take the time to do
		a full “reading” for him.
		You must specialize in a particular
		mantic art. Available specialties
		include Astrology, Augury (interpreta-
		tion of natural omens, such as flocks
		of birds), Crystal Gazing, Dream
		Interpretation, Feng Shui, Palmistry,
		and Tarot.
		This skill is not  a paranormal tal-
		ent, and the GM is under no obligation
		to supply you with hints of future
		events. You might wish to learn this
		skill if you have actual divinatory abil-
		ities, though, as it enables you to pres-
		ent your predictions in a culturally
		acceptable way. “I saw it in the stars”
		may be less likely to get you burned as
		a witch than “I cast a spell”!
		Modifiers: +1 for Sensitive or +3 for
		Empathy (p. 51); any Charisma 
		bonus; -3 if using Fortune-Telling in
		place of Fast-Talk, Interrogation, or

		gets (with map and compass at TL6-,
		global positioning systems and satel-
		lite imagery at TL7+), marking targets
		matching ordnance to target for best
		effect, and calling in corrections to

		ical failures (GM’s decision) drop the

		to improve the rate of fire of certain
		crew-served weapons; see individual
		weapon descriptions for details.
		You  must  specialize by weapon
		type. The available specialties vary by
		TL, but include one or more of:
		Beams: Any kind of heavy directed-
		energy weapon: laser, particle beam,
		etc.
		Cannon: Any kind of heavy projec-
		tile weapon – e.g., the main gun of a
		tank or an ultra-tech railgun on a star-
		ship – that fires single shots.
		Catapult: Any kind of large, direct-
		fire mechanical bolt-thrower, such as
		a ballista.
		Machine Gun: Any kind of heavy
		projectile weapon capable of firing
		bursts.
		Rockets: Any kind of free-flight
		rocket fired from a mount.
		These specialties default to one

		each specialty vary by TL. For
		instance, Gunner (Machine Gun) cov-
		ers hand-cranked Gatling guns at TL5,
		automatic machine guns at TL6, auto-
		cannon at TL7, and electromagnetic
		machine guns at TL9+.
		Familiarity is crucial here!
		Gunner/TL7 (Machine Gun) covers
		both tripod-mounted machine guns

		until you familiarize yourself with all

		fires a bursting projectile. Includes
		under-barrel grenade launchers, flare
		pistols, and ultra-tech “tanglers.”
		Gyroc: Any kind of small arm that
		fires miniature rockets.
		Light Anti-Armor Weapon (LAW):
		All forms of rocket launchers and
		recoilless rifles.
		Light Machine Gun (LMG): Any
		machine gun fired from the hip or a
		bipod.
		Musket:  Any kind of smoothbore
		long arm (usually, but not always, a
		black powder weapon) that fires a
		solid projectile.
		Pistol: All kinds of handguns,
		including derringers, pepperboxes,
		revolvers, and automatics, but not

		by each specialty vary by TL. For
		example, Guns (Rifle) covers muzzle-

		ammunition varies with TL, from
		black powder and loose shot at TL4, to
		smokeless powder cartridges at TL6,
		to power cells and metallic slivers for
		TL9+ electromagnetic guns.
		Familiarity is crucial here! Guns

		This skill represents knowledge
		that is lost, deliberately hidden, or
		simply neglected. Whatever the rea-
		son, the general public is unaware of
		it. It is only available to those who
		study it specifically.
		You must specialize in a particular
		body of secret knowledge. If you wish
		to enter play with Hidden Lore skills,
		you must account for this specific
		knowledge in your character story.
		The GM might even require you to
		purchase an Unusual Background
		before you can learn Hidden Lore
		skills. Of course, the GM is also free to
		forbid  Hidden Lore skills to starting
		characters . . . or to PCs in general!
		To acquire Hidden Lore in play,
		you must find a reliable source of rel-
		evant information. The GM may
		choose to tie skill increases in Hidden
		Lore to specific acts – such as reading
		moldy tomes – instead of allowing you
		to spend points freely. For instance, an
		ancient manuscript might let you
		spend up to eight points (and no
		more) on a specific Hidden Lore skill.
		Remember that most Hidden Lore
		is secret because somebody powerful
		wants it kept that way. Thus, dis-
		cussing or revealing your knowledge
		can be extremely hazardous.
		Possible Hidden Lore specialties
		include:
		Conspiracies:  You know details
		about the conspiracies that underlie
		every aspect of society. This is factual
		knowledge (e.g., truths about the
		Illuminati), not the ability to analyze
		conspiracies. Only available in set-
		tings where vast conspiracies really do
		exist.
		Demon Lore: You know the secrets
		of Hell, the goals of demons in the
		mortal world, and possibly even the
		names of specific demons.
		Faerie Lore: You have detailed
		knowledge of the faeries and their
		secret kingdom(s).
		Spirit Lore: You know about ghosts
		and other spirit entities – names,
		motivations, etc.

		might (at the GM’s option) allow you
		to remember a useful parallel: “Ah,

		This is the skill of inducing a sug-
		gestible state in another person
		through verbal or mechanical means.
		It requires five seconds and a success-
		ful skill roll to use. If you fail on a
		cooperative subject, you may try again.
		The second attempt takes five min-
		utes,  and the roll is at -5. If this
		attempt fails, you may not try to hyp-
		notize the subject again that day.
		A successful Hypnotism attempt
		puts the subject to sleep. This counts
		as an anesthetic for the purpose of
		Surgery. At the GM’s option, further
		Hypnotism rolls might help the sub-
		ject remember something he had for-
		gotten, while Psychology rolls might
		help him get over mental problems.
		A hypnotized individual is extreme-
		ly suggestible. Roll a Quick Contest of
		Hypnotism vs. the victim’s Will for
		each suggestion. The subject resists
		suggestions that threaten his life or his
		loved ones, or that go strongly against
		his character, at +5. You may also give
		ing the subject to do something in
		response to a trigger after the hypno-
		sis ends. The subject’s resistance roll
		for such suggestions takes place when
		he encounters the trigger. He resists at
		notized.
		You cannot  use Hypnotism as an
		attack, except in highly cinematic
		games. You can use it on an unaware
		or unwilling subject out of combat,
		but he resists at Will+5. If he resists
		the initial attempt, he is considered
		uncooperative, and you may not make
		a second attempt that day. A subject
		who is unfamiliar with Hypnotism
		might not know what you attempted,
		but he suspects something – possibly
		witchcraft!
		In all cases, a hypnotic trance lasts
		1d hours unless you end it sooner.
		Modifiers: +2 if you send hypnotic
		suggestions via Telesend (see Tele-
		communication, p. 91), since voices in
		the head are harder to ignore.

		roll whenever an attack (e.g., a shove
		or the Push skill, p. 216) would result

		On a success, you neither experi-
		ence knockback nor fall down. On a
		failure, you are knocked back but still
		get the usual DX roll to avoid falling
		down. On a critical failure, you auto-
		matically suffer full knockback and
		you fall down.

		unrestrained hand (although it need
		not be empty).
		Breath:  Any attack emitted from

		acidic sputum. To use this skill, you
		cannot be gagged and you must  be
		facing your target.
		Gaze: Any attack emitted from the
		eyes – heat vision, a petrifying stare,
		etc. To use this skill, you cannot be
		blindfolded and you must  be facing

		This is the ability to analyze and

		you to deduce enemy plans and capa-
		bilities, evaluate the accuracy of infor-
		mation, rate the reliability of sources,
		etc. In most game worlds, only intelli-
		gence, military, and security services
		teach this skill – often only to those
		with a minimum level of Rank or
		Security Clearance.
		The GM makes all Intelligence
		Analysis rolls in secret. On a success,
		he provides details about the signifi-
		cance and accuracy of your data, or
		insights into what it means in terms of
		enemy planning. When you encounter
		deliberately falsified data, the GM
		rolls a secret Quick Contest: your
		Intelligence Analysis vs. the enemy’s
		skill at disinformation (Forgery,
		Propaganda, etc.). If you win, the GM
		provides details on precisely what is
		wrong with the information. It is up to
		you to deduce what this means, how-
		ever!
		This skill has nothing to do with
		gathering  intelligence. Use Current
		Affairs (p.186) and Research (p. 217) to
		sift through public sources; Forensics
		physical clues; Observation (p. 211) for
		human surveillance; and Electronics
		Operation (p. 189) to work with the
		satellite imagery, communications
		intercepts, and related “technical
		means” common at TL7+.
		You may take an optional specialty
		ligence. A useful specialty at TL6+ is
		Intelligence Analysis (Traffic
		Analysis): identifying the purpose and
		organization of targets by examining
		intercepted communications traffic.
		Modifiers: -1 to -5 for incomplete
		information; -3 if all your information
		comes from a single source; -3 for
		intelligence concerning an arcane sci-
		entific or bureaucratic principle,
		unless you have skill in that area (e.g.,

		threats; +6 if you use torture*.

		This is the skill of hostile persua-

		convince the subject that you are able
		and willing, perhaps even eager, to do
		something awful to him.
		You can substitute an Intimidation
		attempt for any reaction roll; see
		Influence Rolls (p. 359).  Exception:
		You cannot intimidate someone who
		has the Unfazeable advantage!
		The results of a successful
		Intimidation attempt depend on the

		cooperates, sullenly or with false
		cheer. A low-life might lick your boots
		really tough sort might react well
		without being frightened: “You’re my
		kind of scum!” The GM decides, and
		roleplays it. If you rolled a critical suc-
		cess – or if the subject critically failed
		his Will roll – your victim must make
		a Fright Check in addition to the other
		results of the Influence roll!
		Group Intimidation: You may
		attempt to intimidate up to 25 people
		at once, at -1 to skill per five people (or
		fraction thereof) in the group.
		Multiple intimidators can attempt to
		intimidate proportionally larger
		groups; for instance, three thugs could
		try to intimidate up to 75 people! Base
		the skill penalty on the size of the tar-
		get group divided by the number of
		intimidators (round up). Resolve the
		outcome with a single Quick Contest:
		the highest effective Intimidation skill
		from among the intimidators vs. the
		highest modified Will in the target
		group.

		vs. the subject’s IQ before  your

		appear to be intimidating when you

		This skill represents any advanced
		training at unarmed throws and grap-
		ples – not just the eponymous
		Japanese martial art.
		Judo allows you to parry two differ-
		ent  attacks per turn, one with each
		hand. Your Parry score is (skill/2) + 3,
		rounded down. This parry is not at the
		usual -3 for parrying a weapon bare-
		handed, greatly reducing the likeli-
		hood of injury when you defend
		against an armed foe. In addition,
		Judo gives an improved retreating
		bonus when you parry; see Retreat
		ing barehanded, see Parrying Unarmed
		On the turn immediately after a
		successful Judo parry, you may
		attempt to throw your attacker if he is
		within one yard. This counts as an
		attack; roll vs. Judo skill to hit. (Note
		that in an All-Out Attack, you cannot
		attempt two throws, but you can make
		one attempt at +4.) Your foe may use
		any active defense – he can parry your
		hand with a weapon! If his defense
		fails, you throw him.
		When you throw a foe, he falls
		where you please. On a battle map, he
		lands in any two hexes near you. One
		of these hexes must be his starting
		hex, your hex, or any hex adjacent to
		one of those hexes. Your victim must
		roll against HT; a failed roll means he
		is stunned! If you throw him into
		someone else, that person must roll
		against the higher of ST+3 or DX+3 to
		avoid being knocked down.
		Finally, you may use your Judo skill
		instead of your DX for any DX roll
		made in close combat except to draw a
		weapon or drop a shield. If you grapple
		a foe using Judo, and he fails to break
		free, you may make a Judo attack to
		throw him on your next turn, exactly
		as if you had parried his attack.
		To use Judo, any hand with which
		you wish to parry or grapple must be
		empty. Because Judo relies heavily on
		footwork, all Judo rolls and Judo par-
		ries take a penalty equal to your
		encumbrance level. For instance,

		does let you make several special

		calculate damage with Karate attacks:
		punches, kicks, elbow strikes, etc. Add
		or better! Work out damage ahead of

		heavy gauntlets, brass knuckles, etc. to
		increase damage). Because Karate
		relies heavily on footwork, all Karate

		Prerequisites: Trained By A Master

		You can channel your chi outward
		in a mighty shout (kiai) that freezes
		lesser foes. This counts as an attack,
		and costs 1 FP per attempt, successful
		or not.
		Roll a Quick Contest: your Kiai
		skill vs. your target’s Will. You are at -1
		for every full two yards of distance.
		Your victim resists at +1 if he is Hard
		of Hearing, at +2 if Deaf! If you win,
		your target is mentally stunned (see
		Effects of Stun, p. 420).
		This skill only works against a sin-
		gle victim; everyone can hear the
		shout, but your chi is focused on that
		one foe. However, a successful Kiai
		roll gives you +2 to Intimidation rolls
		vs. everyone within earshot.

		This skill represents knowledge of
		law codes and jurisprudence. A suc-
		cessful roll lets you remember,
		deduce, or figure out the answer to a
		question about the law. Few legal
		questions have clear-cut answers,
		however – even an expert will hedge
		his advice!
		You must specialize. There are two
		general classes of specialty:
		region (e.g., Canada or France) within
		a specific field (constitutional, con-
		tract, criminal, police, etc.). Examples:
		Law (British Criminal), Law
		associated with a political region.
		Examples: Law (Catholic Canon), Law
		Specialties within the same region,
		such as Law (British Criminal) and
		Law (British Police), or field, such as
		Law (British Criminal) and Law
		another at -4. If both region and field
		differ, the default is -6 or worse.
		In some times and places, a Quick
		Contest of Law (Criminal) between
		the defense and prosecution will
		determine the outcome of a trial. In
		others, Law functions as an Influence
		skill (see Influence Rolls, p. 359) used
		to sway the rulings of the judge.
		Law enforcers nearly always have a
		point or two in Law (Police) for their
		region. This represents knowledge of
		arrests, evidence handling, interroga-
		tion, etc.

		This is the ability to coordinate a

		NPCs into a dangerous or stressful sit-
		uation. (PCs can decide for themselves
		if they want to follow you!)
		You may attempt a Leadership roll
		in combat if you spend your turn
		doing nothing  but giving orders and
		encouragement. On a success, every-
		one on your side who can hear you
		related Fright Checks and morale
		checks, and on self-control rolls for
		disadvantages that would reduce com-
		bat efficiency (such as Berserk and
		Cowardice – or Bloodlust, if you wish
		to take prisoners). A critical success
		gives +2. The bonus lasts until your
		next turn, at which time you may roll
		again. A group can have only one
		leader, however! If multiple people
		attempt Leadership rolls, no one gets a
		bonus.
		Note that a minimum level of
		Leadership is often a prerequisite for
		high Rank (p. 29).
		Modifiers: Any bonus for Charisma
		NPCs have never been in action with
		you; -5 if you are sending them into
		danger but not going yourself; +5 if
		their loyalty to you is “Good”; +10 if
		their loyalty is “Very Good.” If their
		loyalty is “Excellent,” you do not have
		to roll!

		This skill allows you to exert very
		little pressure when you walk. On a
		successful Light Walk roll, you leave
		no visible tracks. Tracking rolls to fol-
		low you automatically fail unless they
		rely on something more than sight;
		thus, a human tracker would be baf-
		fled, but bloodhounds would suffer no
		penalty at all.
		You can also attempt to walk over
		fragile surfaces without falling
		through. Maximum Move under such
		circumstances is 1/3 normal (GM’s
		decision). Thin ice would require an
		unmodified Light Walk roll, while rice
		paper would require a roll at -8!
		Finally, a successful Light Walk roll
		can give a bonus to Stealth when your
		intention is to move quietly. This
		bonus equals half your margin of suc-
		cess, rounded down. Minimum bonus
		is +1.

		read lips, they can hide their mouths
		or subvocalize to thwart you. A critical

		Make an IQ-based Liquid Projector
		roll to take immediate action (e.g.,
		patch a leak), should your weapon fail.
		You  must  specialize by weapon
		type:
		Flamethrower:  Any weapon that
		projects burning  liquid or gas. (This
		does  not  include plasma weapons,
		which are often called “flamers”; use
		Beam Weapons skill for those.)
		Sprayer:  Any weapon that emits a
		gas or atomized liquid (nerve gas,
		sleeping gas, etc.), including an ordi-
		nary spray can used as an improvised
		weapon.
		Squirt Gun: Any weapon that fires a
		low-pressure stream of liquid at the
		rate of one squirt per pull of the trigger.
		Water Cannon: Any weapon that
		fires a continuous jet of high-pressure
		liquid, usually but not always water,
		with the intent of causing knockback.
		These specialties default to one
		another at -4. The weapons covered by
		each specialty vary by TL; e.g., Liquid
		Projector (Flamethrower) covers fire-
		siphons loaded with Greek fire at TL4,
		while at TL6, it covers backpack tanks
		that project thickened fuel.
		Modifiers:  All applicable ranged
		combat modifiers; -2 for heavy
		weapons when you are used to
		portable weapons (e.g., a flamethrow-
		er mounted on a tank when you are
		used to a backpack model), or for an
		unfamiliar weapon of a known type; -4
		or more for a weapon in bad repair.

		This is the scientific study of quan-

		use of numbers and symbols. You
		must specialize:
		Applied: The branch of mathematics
		that interacts directly with the physical
		sciences and engineering, dealing with
		mathematical models of the behavior of
		physical systems. Defaults: Engineer
		Computer Science: The theoretical
		study of data structures and computa-
		tion. Roll vs. skill to answer questions
		about what is possible with comput-
		ers. This gives you no special ability to
		use  computers!  Default: Computer
		Programming-5.
		Cryptology: The mathematical
		study of codes and ciphers. This gives
		you a theoretical understanding of
		encryption schemes, including how
		they change with TL and why 
		some schemes are more effective than
		others. To create or break codes, use
		Cryptography skill (p. 186). Default:
		Cryptography-5.
		Pure:  Generic “academic” mathe-
		matics. Make a skill roll to answer any
		math-related question not covered by
		another specialty. Pure mathematics
		encompasses dozens of obscure sub-
		fields that will never affect the game. If
		you  must be an expert in something
		like “non-selfadjoint operator alge-
		bras,” you may further note an option-
		al specialty (p. 169).
		Statistics: The science of assem-
		bling and analyzing data for the pur-
		pose of calculating probabilities, con-
		structing models, and making fore-
		casts. Roll vs. skill to determine the
		odds of a particular outcome, given
		sufficient data about similar situa-
		tions in the past.
		Surveying:  The science of deter-
		mining the area of a portion of the
		Earth’s surface, the lengths and direc-
		tions of the bounding lines, and the
		contour of the surface. Make a skill
		roll to determine the dimensions of
		any area you can see. More complex
		determinations require specialized
		equipment. Defaults: Cartography-3 or
		Navigation (any)-4.
		These specialties default to one
		another at -5.

		This is the ability to diagnose and
		fix ordinary mechanical problems. A
		successful skill roll will let you find or
		repair one problem.
		You must pick a specialty from
		within one of these four categories:
		Machine Type: Any one class of
		nonvehicular machine. Types include
		Micromachines (miniature machin-
		ery, invisible to the naked eye; TL9+),
		Nanomachines (molecular-scale
		machinery; TL10+), and Robotics
		TL7+).
		Motive System Type: Any one type
		of propulsion system, regardless of
		vehicle type. Types include Legged,
		Tracked, Wheeled, Rockets, and
		Reactionless Thrusters.
		Power Plant Type: Any one type 
		of power plant, no matter what it 
		powers. Types include Clockwork,
		Steam Engine, Gasoline Engine,
		Diesel Engine, Gas Turbine, Fuel Cell,
		Fission Reactor, Fusion Reactor, and
		Antimatter Reactor.
		Vehicle Type: The controls, hull,
		motive system, power plant, transmis-
		sion, and even the paint job of one spe-
		cific type of vehicle listed under a vehi-
		cle-operation skill such as Driving
		Submarine (p. 223).
		Mechanic specialties default to one
		another at -4, although the GM may
		modify this for particularly close or dis-
		tant specialties. The systems covered by
		each specialty vary by TL. For instance,
		Mechanic (Light Airplane) covers sin-
		gle-engine biplanes at early TL6, small
		private jets at TL7, and so forth.
		Familiarity is very important here.
		For instance, Mechanic/TL7 (Light
		Airplane) covers both propeller-pow-
		ered seaplanes and small private jets,
		but going from one to the other gives
		you -2 for an unfamiliar item (prop-
		powered plane to jet) and -2 for an
		unfamiliar implementation (seaplane
		to regular plane), for a net -4 to skill
		until you familiarize yourself with all
		the differences.
		Modifiers: -2 for an unfamiliar item
		within your specialty (e.g., a barge
		when you’re used to battleships), or
		for an unfamiliar implementation
		used to automobile engines); equip-
		ment modifiers (p. 345).

		This is not one skill, but an entire
		collection  of skills – one per class of
		closely related melee weapons. Melee
		Weapon skills are based on DX, and
		default to DX-4 if Easy, DX-5 if
		Average, or DX-6 if Hard. See specific
		skill descriptions for other defaults.
		Make a Melee Weapon roll to hit an
		opponent in combat. You may also use
		these skills to parry. Your Parry
		defense is (skill/2) + 3, rounded down.
		Melee weapons fall into broad cat-
		egories on the basis of overall balance
		and function. When a rule refers to
		one of these categories, it applies to all
		weapons in that category and all
		Melee Weapon skills used to wield
		them. For instance, “fencing
		weapons” means “all weapons used
		with any of Main-Gauche, Rapier,
		Saber, or Smallsword skill.”
		Fencing Weapons
		Fencing weapons are light, one-
		handed weapons, usually hilted
		blades, optimized for parrying. If you
		have a fencing weapon, you get an
		improved retreating bonus when you
		parry – see Retreat (p. 377).
		Furthermore, you have half  the usual
		penalty for parrying more than once
		with the same hand (see Parrying,
		p. 376).
		Note that fencing weapons are light
		and likely to break when used to parry
		a heavier weapon. They cannot parry
		flail weapons at all! You must be rela-
		tively mobile to capitalize on their
		speed and maneuverability: all attacks
		and parries take a penalty equal to
		your encumbrance level (e.g., Heavy
		encumbrance gives -3 to hit or to
		parry).
		The skills in this category default to
		one another at -3. They also default to
		sword skills, as noted below.
		Main-Gauche (DX/Average): Any
		weapon normally wielded with Knife
		or Jitte/Sai skill (see below), used in
		the “off” hand. With this skill, you may
		ignore the penalty for using the “off”
		hand on defense (attacks are still at -4)
		and the -1 for parrying with a knife. To
		wield a knife as a primary weapon, use
		Knife skill. Defaults: Jitte/Sai-4 or
		Knife-4.
		Rapier (DX/Average): Any long (over
		1 yard), light thrusting sword. Default:
		Broadsword-4.
		Saber (DX/Average): Any light cut-
		and-thrust sword. Note that cavalry
		sabers are quite heavy, and use
		Broadsword instead. Defaults:
		Broadsword-4 or Shortsword-4.
		Smallsword (DX/Average): Any
		short (up to 1 yard), light thrusting
		sword or one-handed short staff (such
		as the sticks used in the martial arts
		arnis, escrima, and  kali).  Default:
		Shortsword-4.
		Flails
		A  flail is any flexible, unbalanced
		weapon with its mass concentrated in
		the head. Such a weapon cannot parry
		if you have already attacked with it on
		your turn. Because flails tend to wrap
		around the target’s shield or weapon,
		attempts to block them are at -2 and
		attempts to parry them are at -4.
		Fencing weapons and knives cannot
		parry them at all! An unarmed fighter
		can parry a flail, but at -4 in addition
		to any penalty for parrying unarmed.
		The skills in this category default to
		one another at -3.
		Flail (DX/Hard): Any one-handed
		flail, such as a morningstar or nun-
		chaku. Default: Axe/Mace-4.
		Two-Handed Flail (DX/Hard): Any
		two-handed flail. Defaults: Kusari-4 or
		Two-Handed Axe/Mace-4.
		Impact Weapons
		An  impact weapon is any rigid,
		unbalanced weapon with most of its
		mass concentrated in the head. Such a
		weapon cannot parry if you have
		already attacked with it on your turn.
		The skills in this category default to
		one another at -3.
		Axe/Mace (DX/Average): Any short-
		or medium-length, one-handed impact
		weapon, such as an axe, hatchet,
		knobbed club, or pick. Default: Flail-4.
		Two-Handed Axe/Mace
		impact weapon, such as a baseball
		bat, battleaxe, maul, or warhammer.
		Defaults: Polearm-4 or Two-Handed
		Flail-4.
		Pole Weapons
		Pole  weapons are long (usually
		wooden) shafts, often adorned with
		striking heads. All require two hands.
		Polearm (DX/Average): Any very  long
		weapon with a heavy striking head,
		including the glaive, halberd, poleaxe, and
		countless others. Polearms become
		unready  after an attack, but not after a
		parry.  Defaults: Spear-4, Staff-4, or Two-
		Handed Axe/Mace-4.
		Spear (DX/Average): Any long, bal-
		anced pole weapon with a thrusting
		point, including spears, javelins, tri-
		dents, and fixed bayonets. Defaults:
		Polearm-4 or Staff-2.
		Staff (DX/Average): Any long, bal-
		anced pole without  a striking head.
		This skill makes good use of the staff’s
		extensive parrying surface when
		defending, giving +2 to your Parry
		score. Defaults: Polearm-4 or Spear-2.
		Swords
		A sword is a rigid, hilted blade with
		a thrusting point, cutting edge, or both.
		All swords are balanced, and can attack
		and parry without becoming unready.
		Broadsword (DX/Average): Any bal-
		anced,  2- to 4-foot blade wielded in
		one hand – broadsword, cavalry saber,
		scimitar, etc. This skill also covers any
		stick or club of similar size and bal-
		ance to these blades, as well as bastard
		swords, katanas, and longswords used
		one-handed. Defaults: Force Sword-4,
		Rapier-4, Saber-4, Shortsword-2, or
		Two-Handed Sword-4.
		Force Sword (DX/Average): Any
		sword with a “blade” made of energy
		instead of matter. This generally refers
		to an ultra-tech weapon that projects
		energy from a powered hilt, but
		extends to similar effects produced
		using magic or psionics. Default: any
		sword skill at -3.
		Jitte/Sai (DX/Average): Any tined,
		one-handed sword designed to catch
		rigid weapons. Jitte/Sai weapons are
		built for disarming, and give +2 in the
		Quick Contest to disarm an opponent
		Furthermore, if you attempt to disarm
		on the turn immediately  after you
		parry your opponent’s weapon, you
		need not roll to hit his weapon first.
		Just state that you are attempting to
		disarm and move directly to the Quick
		Contest! This still counts as an attack.
		Defaults: Force Sword-4, Main-
		Gauche-4, or Shortsword-3.
		Knife (DX/Easy): Any rigid, hilted
		blade less than one foot long, from a
		pocketknife to a bowie knife. A knife
		has a very small parrying surface,
		which gives you -1 to your Parry score.
		Defaults: Force Sword-3, Main-
		Gauche-3, or Shortsword-3.
		Shortsword (DX/Average): Any  bal-
		anced, one-handed weapon 1-2 feet in
		length – including the shortsword and
		any club of comparable size and 
		balance (e.g., a police baton). 
		Defaults: Broadsword-2, Force
		Sword-4, Jitte/Sai-3, Knife-4, Saber-4,
		Smallsword-4, or Tonfa-3.
		Two-Handed Sword (DX/Average):
		Any balanced, two-handed blade over 4
		feet in length: greatswords, zweihan-
		ders, etc. This skill also covers 
		quarterstaffs wielded like swords, as
		well as bastard swords, katanas, and
		longswords used two-handed. Defaults:
		Broadsword-4 or Force Sword-4.
		Whips
		A whip  is a flexible weapon made
		from a length of chain, leather, wire,
		etc. A whip can be up to seven yards
		long – but note that a whip two yards
		or more in length cannot strike at one
		yard or closer, and is slow to ready
		after an attack. A whip tends to wind
		around its target, making it an excel-
		lent disarming and entangling
		weapon. However, a whip’s lack of
		rigidity makes it a poor parrying
		weapon. For details, see Special Melee
		Weapon Rules (p. 404).
		The skills in this category default to
		one another at -3.
		Force Whip (DX/Average): Any whip
		made of pure energy instead of matter.
		These are usually ultra-tech devices
		that project energy from a powered
		hilt, but magical or psi-tech versions
		are possible. Most force whips can
		lash the target but not ensnare him.
		Kusari (DX/Hard): A weighted
		chain wielded in two hands. Default:
		Two-Handed Flail-4.
		Monowire Whip (DX/Hard): A whip
		made of a weighted length of
		monomolecular wire attached to a
		handle.
		Whip (DX/Average): Any ordinary
		whip.
		Other Weapons
		Some hand weapons defy easy
		classification. For instance:
		Tonfa (DX/Average): A tonfa is a
		baton with a protruding handle on one
		side. It can function as a baton, but
		you can also grasp it by the handle and
		hold it against the forearm in close
		combat. This grip lets you jab for
		thrust+1 crushing damage and parry
		close-combat attacks at (skill/2) + 3,
		rounded down. Roll vs. skill to change
		grips. On a success, the grip change is
		a free action. On a failure, you must
		spend the entire turn changing grips. A
		critical failure means you throw your
		weapon away! Default: Shortsword-3.

		This is the skill of buying, selling,

		goods. It involves bargaining, sales-
		manship, and an understanding of
		trade practices. It covers all types of
		merchandise, but many merchants
		have an optional specialty (p. 169) in a
		single class of goods.
		Make a skill roll to judge the value
		of any piece of common goods, find
		out where any commodity is bought
		and sold, find the local fair market
		value of any commodity, etc.
		When two merchants haggle, the
		GM may settle it with a Quick Contest.
		The winner adds or subtracts 10% of
		fair value, depending on whether he
		was trying to sell or buy.
		If you have this skill at any level,
		you get +1 on reaction rolls when buy-
		ing or selling. If you have this skill at
		level 20 or better, you get +2.
		Modifiers: -3 for Gullibility (p. 137);
		Shyness (p. 154). -3 for illegal goods,
		unless you have Streetwise at 12+ or
		specialize in such goods; -2 in an unfa-

		This is the study of the weather,
		and the ability to predict it. It includes
		familiarity with technological aids
		such as barometers and satellite maps,
		but you can still function without your
		instruments. (If you can’t, you’re a
		meter-reader, not a meteorologist!)
		When you wish to predict the
		weather, the GM rolls against your skill
		in secret. On a success, he tells the
		truth; on a failure, he answers ran-
		domly, or lies. Each skill roll predicts
		the weather for one day. If one day’s
		roll fails, subsequent ones can’t suc-
		ceed. For instance, a three-day forecast
		would require three skill rolls: the first
		for tomorrow, the second for the next
		day, and the third for the day after that.
		A successful roll also allows you to
		deduce what sort of general climate to
		expect when you visit a new area.
		At TL4 or less, this skill is called
		Weather Sense, and you get +2 to skill
		in your home area. At TL5 and up,
		Meteorology is a scientific skill, and
		you must specialize by planet type; see
		Planet Types (p. 180) for details.
		Modifiers:  Time is a major factor!
		There is no penalty to predict tomor-
		row’s weather, but you have -1 for 2
		days, -2 for 3 days, -4 for 4 days, -6 for
		5 days, and an additional -2 per day
		for each further day. Instrumentation
		becomes useful with the development
		of the barometer at TL4, after which
		equipment modifiers (p. 345) apply.

		default to claim bonuses for good

		lion’s roar, a wolf’s howl, a frog’s croak,
		etc. You can only imitate animals that
		have distinctive sounds. Make a skill
		roll to attract animals of the type mim-
		icked – or predators that normally
		hunt those animals – if any are nearby.
		To fool people, you must win a Quick
		Contest of Mimicry vs. the listeners’
		Naturalist-3 or Perception-6. Default:
		Naturalist-6.
		Bird Calls: Allows you to reproduce
		the whistles, chirps, and other sounds
		made by birds. Otherwise, this 
		works as Animal Sounds. Default:
		Naturalist-6.
		Speech:  Enables you to imitate
		vocal sounds. This does not allow you
		to converse in a foreign language, but
		if you have heard it, you can repro-
		duce the sound of it. If you are trying
		to mimic a specific person, roll at -3.
		Treat this roll as a Quick Contest vs.
		the IQ of anyone who knows the per-
		son mimicked well. Defaults: Acting-6
		or Linguistics-4.
		Animal Sounds and Bird Calls
		default to one another at -6. There is

		This ability allows you to establish

		ical attempts to eavesdrop on your
		thoughts and emotions. The tech-
		niques involved are wholly mundane –
		for instance, doing complicated math-
		ematical calculations, or repeating
		poetry over and over again. With suffi-
		cient training, anyone  can learn this
		skill.
		To maintain a block, you must
		make a Mind Block roll once per
		minute. You must roll every second in
		combat or other stressful situations.
		If you succeed, anyone who reads
		your mind must win a Quick Contest
		of his mind-reading ability vs. your
		Mind Block skill in order to get useful
		information. Otherwise, he gets noth-
		ing but poetry, multiplication tables,
		etc. However, if you ever critically fail
		a Mind Block roll, you thought about
		precisely what the mind reader want-
		ed to know – in detail – right there in
		the forefront of your mind!
		This skill only works against mind
		reading,  not mind control or other
		mental attacks. If you have a super-
		natural mind shield, Mind Block acts
		as a last-ditch defense: only mental
		probes that pierce your magical or
		psionic defenses and contact your
		mind will encounter the block.
		Modifiers: +2 if you do nothing but
		concentrate on blocking; -3 if you are
		mentally or physically stunned; -2 or
		more to hide emotions  rather than
		thoughts, depending on how strong
		the GM rules your emotions are – it’s
		hard to block your emotions while
		sneaking up on your most hated
		enemy!

		Prerequisites: Musical Ability 1 and
		either Musical Instrument or Singing
		at 12+.
		This cinematic skill allows you to
		influence the emotions of others by
		playing a musical instrument or
		singing. In some settings, this is a
		magical or psionic talent, or a special
		form of hypnotism, and works with
		any instrument, as well as with voice.
		In other settings, this skill is associat-
		ed with a specific type of magical or
		ultra-tech instrument.
		To attempt Musical Influence, you
		must first get your audience to sit and
		listen to your performance. You must
		also make a successful Musical
		Instrument or Singing roll. You may
		then roll against your Musical
		Influence skill. On a success, you can
		adjust the reaction roll of your audi-
		ence – to you or to anyone present –
		up  or down by an amount equal to
		your margin of success, to a maxi-
		mum of +3 (+4 for critical success).
		If you have only a few seconds, or
		if the audience is not paying full atten-
		tion to your performance, you may
		adjust reaction rolls by ±1 at most,
		regardless of your margin of success.
		Listeners who do not wish to be
		influenced may resist with Will. Hard
		of Hearing (p. 138) gives +4 to resist,
		and those with Deafness (p. 129) are
		completely immune. However, some
		science-fiction devices generate vibra-
		tions that affect the body,  in which
		case a listener’s sense of hearing is
		irrelevant.
		It is up to the GM to determine
		whether this skill works on animals as
		well as sapient beings. In classic 
		fantasy, it just might!

		This is the talent of observing dan-

		without letting others know that you
		are watching. Use this skill to moni-
		tor a location, a group of people, or
		your immediate surroundings for
		concealed or tactically significant
		details. This is not the same as gath-
		ering clues or making a hands-on
		search (use Forensics and Search,
		respectively) – you always use
		Observation from a distance.
		A successful skill roll lets you
		gather information that is not specif-
		ically hidden. For instance, you could
		case a bank for obvious cameras
		before a robbery, learn the schedule
		of sentries, estimate the size of a
		crowd, or gauge the strength of
		troops moving in the open. The GM
		may require an Intelligence Analysis
		roll to interpret what you observe.
		To spot deliberately hidden details
		you, an armed man hiding in the
		crowd, or a concealed machine-gun
		nest – you must win a Quick Contest
		of Observation skill vs. the Stealth,
		Shadowing, or Camouflage skill (as
		appropriate) of the other party. The
		GM should roll the Contest in secret,
		and should not say, “You don’t see the
		machine gun nest concealed in the
		bushes.”
		If your attempt fails, you get no
		details on an obvious item, or fail to
		spot a hidden one. On a critical fail-
		ure, someone spots you  and reacts
		poorly to the attention . . .
		Modifiers: Acute Senses (p. 35), as
		appropriate; modifiers for cover,

		This is the study of the mysterious
		and the supernatural. An occultist is
		an expert on ancient rituals, haunt-
		ings, mysticism, primitive magical
		beliefs, psychic phenomena, etc. Note
		that an occultist does not have to
		believe in the material he studies!
		In worlds where everyone knows
		that paranormal powers exist,
		Occultism covers lore about these
		powers and their users. A good roll
		might provide insights into phenome-
		na that aren’t related to known pow-
		ers. However, Occultism provides no
		details on how talented individuals
		invoke their powers. For instance, a
		fantasy occultist would know what
		magic can accomplish, and could pro-
		vide advice on slaying demons, but
		without Thaumatology skill (p. 225),
		he could not explain the gestures,
		words, and symbols used by wizards.
		In campaigns where many super-
		natural forces coexist, the GM may
		require occultists to specialize in such
		fields as Demonology (the study of
		demons, possession, and pacts),
		Pneumatology (the study of spirits),
		and Vampirology (the study of

		emergency, but when you learn  this
		skill, always base it on DX.
		Roll against Piloting for takeoffs
		and landings, and in any hazardous
		situation. Failure by 1 indicates a
		rough job; failure by more indicates
		damage to the vehicle. A critical failure
		is a crash! If you have skill 15+, a criti-
		cal failure requires an immediate sec-
		ond roll. Only if the second roll is a fail-
		ure does a mishap occur. Otherwise, it
		was a “near thing,” averted by experi-
		ence. Air combat requires frequent
		Piloting rolls as well.
		Make an IQ-based Piloting roll for
		basic map reading or practical mete-
		orology, or to recall aviation laws and
		regulations.
		Remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs)
		use this skill if the pilot uses some
		form of telepresence to mimic actual-

		This is the ability to draw on your

		blow in melee combat. Roll once per
		attack. Power Blow costs 1 FP per
		attempt, successful or not.
		If successful, double your ST for
		damage purposes for the next attack

		can  triple  your ST by accepting an
		extra -10 to the skill roll.

		triple your ST momentarily in order to
		move a heavy object. Such feats cost 1
		FP and require a skill roll, as described

		Prerequisites: Trained By A Master
		and Pressure Points at 16+.
		This skill represents knowledge of
		the most vulnerable vital points of the
		human body. It allows you to maim
		and kill by crushing and tearing vital
		organs and nerve clusters with deadly
		precision.
		To use this ability, you must make a
		successful unarmed attack. This
		attack is at -2 in addition to any hit
		location modifier (see Hit Location,
		p. 398). If you hit, make a Pressure
		Secrets roll.
		On a success, any damage that pen-
		etrates DR is doubled – or tripled if you
		targeted the vital organs. In effect,
		your hands and feet have become
		impaling weapons!
		You can also use this ability with
		locks and similar grappling attacks.
		This represents knowledge of exactly
		where to apply pressure to tear or
		sprain joints and ligaments. After
		applying the lock, make a Pressure
		Secrets roll. On a success, double the
		damage, shock, or harmful effects of
		the lock for that turn.
		This skill is unrealistic and poten-
		tially unbalancing. The GM should
		carefully weigh its impact before
		allowing it, and may wish to make it
		very difficult for PCs to learn – or even
		restrict it to deadly NPC opponents.
		Modifiers: Physiology modifiers
		Professional Skill
		DX or IQ/Average
		Defaults: Special.
		Many realistic job skills are more
		useful for making a living than for
		adventuring. Most such skills do not
		appear in this skill list – but you can
		still learn them if you want! Each is a
		separate Professional Skill. If your
		earning money, a Professional Skill
		can help you earn a steady income. To
		qualify for most jobs, you will need 
		the relevant Professional Skill at 
		12+ (unless you are supposed  to be
		incompetent!).
		Most professions encompass a
		body of knowledge. The associated
		Professional Skills are IQ/Average and
		default to IQ-5, because the smarter
		you are, the better you can recall and
		employ the techniques used at your
		job. Examples include air traffic con-
		troller, barber, brewer, cooper, distiller,
		dyer, florist, game designer, journalist,
		prostitute, tanner, vintner, and
		zookeeper.
		A few professions – glassblower,
		tailor, weaver, etc. – focus more on
		precision than on recall. These
		Professional Skills are DX/Average
		and default to DX-5.
		At the GM’s option, a given
		Professional Skill might also default to
		other skills. For instance, “Journalist”
		would logically default to Writing-3.
		The skills associated with highly
		paid or respected professions often
		have prerequisites. For instance, “Air
		Traffic Controller” might require
		Electronics Operation (Sensors) skill.
		Like defaults, prerequisites are up to
		the GM.
		You are free to create your own
		Professional Skills, subject to GM
		approval. They should be unique and
		well defined, not just a compilation of
		existing skills. For example:

		This is the skill of indirect persua-

		psychological warfare by intelligence
		and military organizations, and 
		for advertising and marketing in the
		civilian world. Use familiarity (p. 169)
		to reflect the differences between
		these areas.
		Propaganda works on groups, not
		individuals. The GM should set the
		effective Will of the target group based
		on its size, composition, and resist-
		ance to the desired outcome, and then
		use the Influence Rolls (p. 359) rules to
		determine the results. Success might
		inform the target audience or even
		alter its perceptions. Propaganda
		attempts nearly always take more time
		and exposure than ordinary Influence
		rolls, however; how much time is up

		especially a stressful situation.
		In settings with multiple sapient
		species, you must specialize by race.
		Defaults between specialties are up to

		If the GM desires extra detail, he
		may rule that Psychology is split into
		two specialties: Applied (described

		This skill allows you to channel
		your  chi  in order to “gently” push
		away an adversary or cause him to
		lose his balance. Roll against Push
		skill to hit. This counts as a barehand-
		ed attack (see Shove, p. 372), and your
		target may attempt any legal active
		defense.
		If you hit, use the higher of your ST
		or your Push skill as your effective ST.
		Roll  swing damage for that ST, and
		double the result. For instance, if you
		had ST 10 and Push-15, you would roll
		swing damage for ST 15 (2d+1), and
		double it. This damage inflicts knock-
		back (see Knockback, p. 378) but never

		This is the ability to perform reli-

		You  must specialize by religion. This
		skill includes detailed knowledge of
		the ritual motions, prayers, and trap-
		pings of the faith, as well as the ability
		to capture and hold the attention of
		worshipers. For religions that practice
		sacrifice, Religious Ritual also covers

		To be a priest or holy man at TL1+,
		you must have both Religious Ritual
		and Theology skill (p. 226) for your
		religion. TL0 shamans need only learn
		Religious Ritual.
		In worlds where priests can per-
		form miracles, each magical  ritual or
		spell is a separate skill, but certain
		sacrifice – can give bonuses to spell
		rolls. You must always make a suc-
		cessful Religious Ritual roll to claim
		such a bonus. In other settings, a
		priest’s magic is only as good as his rit-
		ual. If this is the case, your roll to work
		magic is against the lower of Religious
		Ritual and your actual spell skill.

		This is the ability to search people,

		aren’t in plain sight. The GM rolls
		once – in secret – per item of interest.
		For  deliberately concealed items, this
		is a Quick Contest of your Search skill
		vs. the Holdout or Smuggling skill
		used to hide the item. If you fail, the
		GM simply says, “You found noth-
		ing.” (It defeats the purpose to say,
		jacket.”)
		If more than one person is search-
		ing, roll separately for each searcher.
		The GM should avoid unnecessary
		rolls. For instance, no human can get
		a sawed-off shotgun through a body
		search. Likewise, a knife or jewel sim-
		ply cannot be found on a normally
		dressed person without an X-ray or
		skin search. In general, if the net
		bonus to the concealer’s Holdout roll
		is +3 or more, a skin search is required.
		If his Holdout is at -2 or worse for size,
		a skin search will automatically find
		the hidden item.

		an unresisting person (takes one
		minute), +3 for a thorough “skin
		search” of a person’s hair and clothing
		plete search, including body cavities

		sel did not go exactly where intended.
		The details depend on the vessel, the
		tech level, and the GM’s judgment, but
		might include weapons being
		enemy), a failed boarding attempt, or
		drifting out of formation with 
		your fleet (which might deny you the
		benefits of area defenses, fire support,
		or tactical communications).
		A critical failure under any circum-
		stances means an appropriate disaster.
		Depending on the TL and situation,
		this could mean running aground, col-
		liding with another vessel, being dis-
		masted, losing your screws or rudder,
		or simply giving an order that your
		crew disregards. Whether they then
		save your ship for you, or mutiny and
		flee, is up to the GM.
		You must specialize:
		Airship:  Blimps, zeppelins, and
		similar large airships. Prerequisites:
		Airshipman, Leadership, and
		Navigation (Air). Defaults:
		Airshipman-5 or Piloting (Lighter-
		Than-Air)-5.
		Ship:  Surface vessels, from tug-
		boats to carriers. Prerequisites:
		Leadership, Navigation (Sea), and
		Seamanship.  Defaults: Seamanship-5,
		or to Boating (Large Powerboat)-5 for
		ships with engines or Boating
		Spaceship: Slower-than-light space-
		craft.  Prerequisites:  Leadership,

		Modifiers: -2 to master an unfamil-
		iar vessel (e.g., an aircraft carrier
		when you’re used to a battleship); -2
		for an unfamiliar crew; -2 or more for
		a vehicle in bad repair.

		This skill represents a combination
		of basic military training – the lessons
		taught at “boot camp” or its equivalent
		in your game world – and actual com-
		bat experience. Only those who have
		served in an army, militia, etc. are like-
		ly to know it.
		The GM may require a Soldier roll
		whenever circumstances would test
		your battlefield discipline (knowing
		when to shoot, use concealment, take
		cover, etc.) or skill at practical field
		survival (e.g., keeping your feet dry
		and eating when you get the chance).
		Roll daily during prolonged military
		action. Failure means an inconven-
		ience – perhaps a minor piece of
		equipment fails. Critical failure indi-
		cates a disaster: “friendly fire” inci-
		dent, trench foot, etc.
		Soldier includes basic lessons in
		many fields covered by other skills.
		For instance, a TL8 soldier learns to
		strip his rifle without learning
		Armoury (Small Arms), to use a radio
		without learning Electronics
		Operation (Comm), to dig a foxhole
		without learning Engineer (Combat),
		and so forth. In a situation where
		someone with one of those skills
		would roll at +4 or better for a routine
		task (see Task Difficulty, p. 345), the
		GM may let you roll against Soldier
		skill instead. You do not receive the
		bonus that someone with the full-
		fledged skill would get, but you do suf-
		fer any situational penalties.
		Soldier can only substitute for skill
		rolls to do things that would be a
		believable part of basic training. This
		means the routine use of standard
		equipment by ordinary troops – not
		research, improvisation, or design,
		and never the operation of new or
		secret technologies! Soldier cannot
		replace weapon skills, either; you
		must buy all such skills separately.
		Example:  If someone with
		Electronics Operation (Comm) would
		be at +4 to call HQ on a standard-issue
		radio, you could do so with a success-
		ful Soldier roll. However, you could
		not use Soldier to fix a broken radio,
		use an enemy radio, or transmit coded
		signals.

		roll at a penalty equal to your margin
		of failure. Roll at +5 if you have

		that nobody will hear you, or follow
		someone without being noticed. (To
		follow someone through a crowd, use

		Quick Contest between your Stealth
		and the sentinel’s Perception.

		game. A successful roll (and about 30
		minutes) gets you within 30 yards of
		most animals. Another roll, at -5, gets
		you within 15 yards.

		places. -5 to move silently if you are
		moving faster than Move 1. -5 to fool

		you must make a successful Survival
		roll once per day. Failure inflicts 2d-4

		the best direction of travel to find
		flowing water, a mountain pass, or

		desire – assuming that it exists.

		ent game . . . so the roll would be at a
		about 30 minutes to improvise a trap
		from ordinary materials, or 10 minutes
		to set and hide a commercial steel trap.
		Pit traps for large game take several
		hours to dig.
		Survival often requires skill rolls
		based on scores other than Percep-
		tion. The GM might ask for a ST-based
		roll to dig a pit trap or erect a log shel-
		ter, a DX-based roll to start a fire using
		primitive techniques (flint sparking,
		bow and palette, etc.), or even a HT-
		based roll to avoid nutritional defi-
		ciencies from an improvised diet.

		type. Land-dwellers may choose from

		Mountain, Plains, Swampland, and
		Woodlands. Aquatic beings may take
		any of Bank, Deep Ocean Vent, Fresh-

		In settings where it is possible to

		cialize by planet. Each Survival spe-
		cialty defaults to the same terrain type
		for a different planet at -4. The defaults
		between terrain types given above are
		at an extra -4 between different plan-
		ets. All this assumes the two planets
		are of the same planet type (see Planet
		Types, p. 180). There is no default at all
		between Survival skills for two planets
		of different planet types.
		At the GM’s option, extreme man-
		made terrain may call for unique spe-
		cialties; e.g., Survival (Radioactive
		Wasteland). Most such specialties
		have no default of any kind.

		This is the art of scribing magical
		symbols. Depending on your magical
		tradition, you might carve these sym-
		bols with a ritual dagger, draw them
		on the ground or an altar using blood
		or ceremonial powders, write them in
		ink, trace them in the air with a wand
		or your fingers, or something else. You
		must specialize in a particular magical
		tradition.
		In traditions where magical power
		flows from the caster, nature, spirits,
		etc. as opposed to the symbols them-
		selves, the symbols provide a focus
		that aids magic use. Roll against
		Symbol Drawing before each ritual.
		On a success, add half your margin of
		success (round down) to your skill
		with the next ritual you conduct over
		the symbols. This kind of Symbol
		Drawing defaults to Ritual Magic
		Drawing (Voodoo) defaults to Ritual
		Magic (Voodoo)-4, and lets you draw
		the vevers used in Voodoo ritual.
		In traditions where the symbols
		themselves  imbue items or places (or
		even  people, in the case of tattoos)
		with magic, the magic is only as good
		as the symbols. Roll against the lower
		of Symbol Drawing and your skill with
		the enchantment itself. This is most
		common in rune magic. Each runic
		alphabet is a separate Symbol
		Drawing skill with no default. For
		instance, Symbol Drawing (Futhark
		Runes) would let you scribe the runes
		used in Norse magic.
		More-exotic traditions may have
		their own rules; see the appropriate
		worldbook for more information.
		Modifiers: -1 or more if using non-
		traditional means to mark the sym-
		bols; -1 or more if placing the symbols
		on any surface other than those 
		prescribed by your tradition.

		This is the ability to outguess and
		outmaneuver the enemy in small-unit
		or personal combat. In most settings,
		only the military teaches this skill.
		When commanding a small unit,
		roll against Tactics to place your
		troops correctly for an ambush, know
		where to post sentries, etc. At the GM’s
		option, a successful roll might even
		provide clues as to immediate enemy
		plans. To outmaneuver enemy units,
		you must win a Quick Contest of
		Tactics with their leader. All of this
		only applies when you lead a group
		small enough that you can give each
		warrior orders personally – or through
		at most one subordinate. Thus, radio
		and similar technologies can greatly
		enhance your command abilities!
		In personal combat, you may make
		a Tactics roll before the fight begins if
		you had any time to prepare. On a suc-
		cess, you start the fight in an advanta-
		geous position – e.g., behind cover or
		on higher ground – as determined by
		the GM. The better the roll, the greater
		your advantage. If you fail, or do not
		attempt a Tactics roll, you are in a ran-
		dom location (or one of the GM’s
		choosing) when combat begins.
		Fighters without Tactics skill always
		start combat this way.
		Even in an ambush or similar “sur-
		prise” situation, the GM will use the
		better  of your Tactics skill and your
		Perception to see if you spotted the
		danger on time.

		care for the beasts, and judge them for
		quality before purchase. If the animals
		are ornery or badly trained (GM’s
		judgment), you must make a success-
		ful Animal Handling roll before you
		can attempt a Teamster roll.
		For normal travel, make a
		Teamster roll once per day. When
		moving at a gallop (80% or more of
		the animals’ full Move) or when exe-
		cuting complex maneuvers with a
		chariot in combat, roll every 10 
		seconds.
		A failure usually means nothing
		worse than lost time or a wider turn
		than intended. A critical failure – or
		any  failure at a gallop – spills the
		wagon or chariot. Treat this as a five-
		yard fall for each passenger and 
		animal involved (see Falling, p. 431).
		As well, roll 2d for each beast; on a 12,
		a leg is broken! You will have to make
		Animal Handling rolls to calm the
		beasts. Time required to reload the
		cargo depends on the load, terrain,
		and weather.
		You  must  specialize by animal
		type; the most common specialty is
		Teamster (Equines), which covers
		horses and mules. Teamster special-
		ties default to one another at -3.

		Anyone may learn this skill, but it is
		easier for a mage; add Magery to IQ
		when learning this skill, just as for

		The main use for this skill is magi-
		cal research. When creating a new
		spell, use the rules for inventing (see
		Chapter 17), but replace Engineer skill
		with Thaumatology. A successful skill
		roll can also identify an unknown spell
		when you see it cast, deduce the rami-
		fications of a critical success or failure
		with magic, determine the spells need-
		ed to enchant a magic item to perform
		as desired, etc. The better your roll,
		the more insight the GM will provide.
		This is the study of fantasy magic –
		fireball spells, rings of power, etc. The
		equivalent skill for traditional, spirit-
		mediated sorcery is Ritual Magic
		require Religious Ritual (p. 217) or
		Theology (p. 226). However, a
		Thaumatology roll at -5 will allow a
		thaumatologist to relate these differ-
		ent varieties of magic to “standard”
		wizardry. Exceptionally weird powers
		or otherworldly artifacts might give a
		larger penalty!
		In traditions where magical power flows from the
		caster, nature, spirits, etc., as opposed to the symbols
		themselves, the symbols provide a focus that aids
